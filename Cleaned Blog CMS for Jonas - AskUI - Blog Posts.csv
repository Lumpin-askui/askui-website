Are your cross-platform workflows constantly breaking due to minor UI changes or unpredictable timing issues?</p><p id="""">As QA teams adopt <strong id="""">Agentic AI</strong> like <strong id="""">AskUI's Vision Agent</strong> the way we write automation is fundamentally changing. We're moving from rigid code to <strong id="""">natural language instructions</strong> that mimic a real user. However, maximizing this potential requires more than just basic prompts.</p><p id="""">In this guide, I share <strong id="""">5 battle-tested, expert-level strategies</strong> that I and my team use every day to transform brittle scripts into stable, intelligent automation across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. If you’re a QA Manager, Test Engineer, or Automation Lead looking for real stability, this is where you start.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">1. The Foundation of Stability: Always Use the simulate Keyword</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">What Users are Asking:</strong> <em id="""">How do I make my tests stop failing randomly due to timing and environmental differences?</em></p><p id="""">The core command of the Vision Agent is act(). While you can instruct the agent to click or type, adding the keyword <strong id="""">simulate</strong> tells the agent to execute the action in a way that <em id="""">most closely resembles human input</em>.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why This Works (Experience):</strong> In my experience building automation for enterprise apps, many timing-related failures (race conditions) are caused by the speed and precision of pure programmatic input. The simulate flag introduces subtle, human-like delays and input paths, which dramatically improves the agent's interaction success rate, especially in complex or heavily animated UIs.</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><style>

Intelligent Customer Service AI Agents - Your 24/7 Business Asset

The landscape of customer service is experiencing a seismic shift as AI agents emerge as the cornerstone of modern business operations. These sophisticated digital assistants are not just automated chatbots; they represent a new paradigm of intelligent, conversational AI that can understand context, learn from interactions, and provide personalized support around the clock. Forward-thinking companies are already witnessing remarkable transformations, with AI agents delivering response times that are 80% faster than traditional support channels while maintaining the nuanced understanding that customers expect.

The implementation strategy for these AI agents requires a comprehensive multi-channel approach that seamlessly integrates across your entire customer touchpoint ecosystem. Your AI agent should operate consistently whether a customer reaches out through live chat on your website, sends an email inquiry, or engages through social media platforms. This unified presence ensures that customers receive the same level of intelligent support regardless of their preferred communication channel, creating a cohesive brand experience that builds trust and loyalty.

A compelling case study from a mid-sized technology company illustrates the transformative power of AI agent implementation. After deploying their customer service AI agent across all channels, they achieved a remarkable 45% reduction in support costs while simultaneously improving their customer satisfaction scores by 23%. The AI agent handled routine inquiries, escalated complex issues to human agents with detailed context, and even proactively reached out to customers experiencing service issues before they contacted support.

The technical requirements for successful AI agent integration center around seamless connectivity with your existing CRM systems. Your AI agent should have real-time access to customer data, purchase history, and previous interaction records to provide contextual, personalized support. This integration enables the AI agent to pull relevant information instantly, reducing resolution times and creating a more satisfying customer experience. Modern AI agent platforms offer robust APIs that connect with popular CRM systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Microsoft Dynamics.

To measure the success of your customer service AI agent implementation, establish a comprehensive ROI calculator framework that tracks both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Monitor response times, resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores, and cost savings on support staff. Additionally, track advanced metrics like conversation completion rates, escalation patterns, and customer retention improvements. These measurements provide concrete data to justify your AI agent investment and identify areas for continuous optimization.

AI Agent Automation for Sales and Lead Generation

The sales landscape is being revolutionized by AI agents that can intelligently qualify leads and nurture prospects through sophisticated, personalized workflows. These AI agents go beyond simple lead capture forms, engaging potential customers in meaningful conversations that assess their needs, budget, timeline, and decision-making authority. By implementing AI agents in your sales process, you can ensure that every lead receives immediate attention and personalized follow-up, dramatically improving conversion rates and sales velocity.

Personalized outreach strategies powered by AI agents represent a quantum leap in sales automation sophistication. These intelligent systems analyze prospect behavior, engagement patterns, and demographic data to craft tailored email sequences and follow-up messages that resonate with individual recipients. The AI agent can adjust messaging tone, timing, and content based on prospect responses, creating a dynamic conversation flow that feels natural and valuable rather than automated and generic.

Seamless integration with sales funnels and CRM platforms ensures that your AI agent becomes an integral part of your existing sales ecosystem. The AI agent should automatically update lead scores, log interactions, schedule follow-ups, and trigger appropriate nurture sequences based on prospect behavior. This integration eliminates data silos and ensures that your sales team has complete visibility into AI agent interactions, enabling them to take over conversations at the optimal moment for closing deals.

A/B testing frameworks for optimizing AI agent conversation flows are essential for maximizing performance and conversion rates. Test different greeting messages, qualifying questions, follow-up sequences, and call-to-action prompts to determine what resonates best with your target audience. Your AI agent platform should provide detailed analytics on conversation performance, allowing you to identify successful patterns and replicate them across all interactions.

Compliance considerations and best practices for automated sales processes require careful attention to regulations like GDPR, CAN-SPAM, and industry-specific requirements. Your AI agent must be configured to obtain proper consent for communications, provide easy opt-out mechanisms, and maintain detailed records of all interactions. Additionally, ensure that your AI agent is transparent about its automated nature while still providing value that prospects appreciate and engage with.

Operational Efficiency Through Process Automation AI Agents

Process automation AI agents are transforming how businesses handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks that traditionally required significant human intervention. These specialized AI agents excel at document processing, data entry, and workflow management, freeing your team to focus on strategic, creative, and relationship-building activities that drive business growth. The key to successful implementation lies in identifying processes that have clear, repeatable patterns and high volume throughput requirements.

Document processing and data entry automation using AI agents can dramatically reduce errors and processing times while improving data consistency across your organization. These AI agents can extract information from invoices, contracts, applications, and other business documents, automatically populating your systems with accurate data. Advanced AI agents can even handle complex document types with varying formats, learning to recognize patterns and adapt to new document structures over time.

Integration capabilities with popular business tools like Slack, Asana, and Microsoft 365 ensure that your process automation AI agents work seamlessly within your existing technology stack. Your AI agent should be able to create tasks, send notifications, update spreadsheets, and generate reports without requiring manual intervention. This level of integration creates a truly automated workflow where information flows smoothly between systems, reducing friction and improving overall operational efficiency.

Developing a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis framework helps identify the highest-impact automation opportunities within your organization. Evaluate processes based on factors like time consumption, error rates, employee satisfaction, and strategic value. Focus your initial AI agent implementations on processes that are highly repetitive, prone to errors, or require significant manual effort. These implementations typically provide the clearest ROI and build momentum for broader AI agent adoption.

Change management strategies for team adoption of AI agent workflows require thoughtful planning and communication. Your employees need to understand how AI agents will enhance their work rather than replace them. Provide comprehensive training, clear documentation, and ongoing support to ensure successful adoption. Create feedback loops that allow team members to suggest improvements and report issues, making them active participants in the AI agent optimization process.

Advanced AI Agent Analytics and Performance Optimization

Measuring AI agent effectiveness requires a comprehensive approach to key performance indicators that go beyond simple metrics like response times or conversation volumes. Focus on business-impact metrics such as conversion rates, customer lifetime value improvements, operational cost reductions, and employee productivity gains. Your AI agent analytics should provide insights into how these digital assistants are contributing to overall business objectives, not just technical performance benchmarks.

Data-driven optimization techniques for improving AI agent responses and accuracy involve continuous analysis of conversation data, user feedback, and outcome tracking. Implement natural language processing improvements based on commonly misunderstood queries, refine response templates based on successful interaction patterns, and update knowledge bases with new information that addresses emerging customer needs. This iterative approach ensures that your AI agent becomes more effective over time.

A/B testing methodologies for conversation flows and user experience improvements should be systematic and statistically significant. Test different conversation paths, response styles, escalation triggers, and engagement strategies to determine optimal configurations for your specific use cases. Your testing framework should account for variables like user demographics, interaction channels, and seasonal patterns that might influence AI agent performance.

Integration with business intelligence tools creates a comprehensive performance tracking ecosystem that connects AI agent activities with broader business outcomes. Your AI agent data should feed into dashboards that show real-time performance metrics, trend analysis, and predictive insights. This integration enables executives and managers to make informed decisions about AI agent investments and optimization priorities.

Predictive analytics capabilities for forecasting AI agent ROI and scaling decisions provide strategic insights that guide long-term planning and resource allocation. Use historical performance data to predict the impact of expanding AI agent capabilities, adding new use cases, or increasing automation coverage. These predictive models help justify additional investments in AI agent technology and ensure that scaling decisions are based on data-driven projections rather than assumptions.

Understanding AI Agent Fundamentals for Business Transformation

The business landscape of 2025 has fundamentally shifted, with AI agents emerging as the cornerstone of intelligent automation that goes far beyond traditional rule-based systems. Unlike conventional automation tools that simply execute predefined tasks, AI agents possess autonomous decision-making capabilities that allow them to analyze situations, adapt to changing conditions, and make intelligent choices without constant human oversight. This revolutionary approach to business automation represents a quantum leap from static workflows to dynamic, responsive systems that can truly transform how your organization operates.

When examining the spectrum of AI agent architectures, we encounter three primary categories that serve distinct business purposes. Reactive AI agents operate on immediate stimulus-response patterns, making them ideal for customer service chatbots and real-time monitoring systems where quick, consistent responses are paramount. Deliberative AI agents employ sophisticated planning and reasoning capabilities, excelling in complex scenarios like strategic planning, resource allocation, and multi-step problem solving. Hybrid AI agents combine both approaches, offering the best of both worlds by providing immediate responses when needed while maintaining the ability to engage in deeper analytical processes for complex challenges.

The 2025 AI agent landscape reveals a mature ecosystem with established leaders and innovative newcomers vying for market dominance. Major platforms like Microsoft's autonomous agent framework, Google's Vertex AI agents, and emerging specialized solutions have created a competitive environment that benefits businesses through improved capabilities and competitive pricing. Current market trends indicate a strong shift toward no-code and low-code AI agent development platforms, making this technology accessible to organizations without extensive technical resources. The integration capabilities with existing business systems have also reached unprecedented levels of sophistication, enabling seamless deployment across diverse technological environments.

Identifying the right business processes for AI agent implementation requires a strategic approach that considers both immediate impact potential and long-term scalability. Customer service operations present the most obvious starting point, where AI agents can handle routine inquiries, escalate complex issues appropriately, and maintain consistent service quality around the clock. Data analysis and reporting processes offer tremendous value, as AI agents can continuously monitor key metrics, generate insights, and alert stakeholders to significant changes or opportunities. Workflow management across departments becomes exponentially more efficient when AI agents coordinate tasks, manage deadlines, and optimize resource allocation based on real-time conditions and historical patterns.

Strategic AI Agent Selection and Planning Framework

Implementing AI agents successfully begins with a comprehensive business process audit that systematically evaluates your organization's operations for automation opportunities. This methodology involves mapping current workflows, identifying bottlenecks and repetitive tasks, calculating the time and cost associated with manual processes, and estimating the potential return on investment for each automation candidate. The audit should also consider the complexity of decision-making required, the availability and quality of data needed for AI agent training, and the potential impact on employee roles and responsibilities.

The evaluation of AI agent platforms requires a structured comparison approach that considers multiple factors beyond initial cost. Leading solutions in 2025 offer varying levels of sophistication, from simple task automation to complex multi-agent orchestration systems. Platform capabilities should be assessed based on their natural language processing quality, integration flexibility, scalability potential, security features, and the robustness of their development and deployment tools. Cost considerations must include not only licensing fees but also implementation costs, ongoing maintenance requirements, and the potential need for additional infrastructure or personnel.

Developing an effective implementation roadmap demands a phased approach that begins with carefully selected pilot projects designed to demonstrate value and build organizational confidence. The initial phase should focus on low-risk, high-visibility processes where success can be easily measured and communicated. Subsequent phases can gradually expand scope and complexity, incorporating lessons learned from earlier deployments. This approach allows organizations to build expertise progressively while minimizing disruption to critical business operations.

Risk assessment and mitigation strategies form a crucial component of any AI agent implementation plan. Data security concerns must address both the protection of sensitive information and the integrity of AI agent decision-making processes. Compliance considerations vary by industry but typically involve ensuring that AI agent actions align with regulatory requirements and maintaining appropriate audit trails. Change management challenges require proactive communication, comprehensive training programs, and clear policies for human-AI collaboration to ensure smooth adoption across the organization.

Step-by-Step AI Agent Implementation Process

Successful AI agent deployment begins with a comprehensive pre-implementation checklist that ensures all foundational elements are in place. Technical requirements assessment must verify that existing infrastructure can support AI agent operations, including adequate computing resources, network connectivity, and data storage capabilities. Team preparation involves identifying key stakeholders, defining roles and responsibilities, and establishing communication protocols for the implementation process. Stakeholder alignment ensures that all relevant parties understand the project objectives, timelines, and expected outcomes, creating the foundation for successful change management.

Installation and configuration best practices vary significantly depending on the chosen platform but share common principles that ensure optimal performance. Most modern AI agent platforms offer cloud-based deployment options that simplify initial setup while providing scalability and reliability. Configuration processes typically involve defining agent objectives, establishing decision-making parameters, integrating data sources, and setting up monitoring and reporting capabilities. Attention to security configurations during this phase prevents future vulnerabilities and ensures compliance with organizational policies.

Integration strategies require careful planning to ensure AI agents can effectively communicate with existing business systems. Modern AI agent platforms typically offer pre-built connectors for popular CRM systems like Salesforce and HubSpot, ERP solutions including SAP and Oracle, and communication tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. Custom integration may be necessary for proprietary systems, requiring API development or middleware solutions to enable seamless data exchange and process coordination.

Testing and validation protocols serve as the final checkpoint before full deployment, ensuring that AI agents perform as intended under various scenarios. Comprehensive testing should include functionality verification, performance benchmarking, security validation, and user acceptance testing. Validation protocols must confirm that AI agent decisions align with business objectives and that error handling mechanisms function properly. This phase often reveals optimization opportunities that can significantly improve agent performance before production deployment.

Training and onboarding procedures play a critical role in ensuring successful human-AI collaboration. Team members need to understand how AI agents operate, when and how to intervene in agent processes, and how to interpret agent-generated insights and recommendations. Effective training programs combine theoretical understanding with hands-on experience, allowing users to build confidence through practical application in controlled environments.

Optimization and Scaling Your AI Agent Ecosystem

Performance monitoring and KPI tracking form the foundation of successful AI agent optimization, providing the data necessary to measure impact and identify improvement opportunities. Key metrics should encompass both operational efficiency measures such as task completion times, error rates, and throughput improvements, as well as business impact indicators including cost savings, revenue generation, and customer satisfaction scores. Advanced monitoring systems can provide real-time dashboards and automated alerting to ensure that performance issues are identified and addressed promptly.

Continuous improvement strategies leverage the vast amounts of data generated by AI agent operations to refine and enhance performance over time. Machine learning capabilities enable agents to learn from their experiences, adapting their decision-making processes based on outcomes and feedback. Feedback loop implementation ensures that human insights and corrections are incorporated into agent learning processes, creating a collaborative environment where human expertise enhances AI capabilities.

Scaling considerations become increasingly important as AI agent implementations prove their value and organizations seek to expand their use across multiple departments and business units. Successful scaling requires standardized deployment processes, centralized governance frameworks, and robust integration architectures that can support multiple agents operating simultaneously. Resource planning must account for increased computational requirements, data storage needs, and the personnel required to manage and optimize an expanded AI agent ecosystem.

Advanced integration techniques enable sophisticated multi-agent coordination that can transform entire business processes through intelligent workflow orchestration. Multiple AI agents can work together on complex projects, with each agent contributing specialized capabilities while coordinating their activities through central orchestration systems. This approach enables organizations to tackle ambitious automation projects that would be impossible with single-agent implementations.

Future-proofing your AI agent strategy requires staying informed about emerging technologies and industry trends while building flexibility into your implementation architecture. The rapid pace of AI development means that new capabilities and platforms regularly emerge, offering opportunities to enhance existing implementations or expand into new use cases. Organizations that maintain modular, standards-based architectures will be best positioned to incorporate new technologies as they become available, ensuring that their AI agent investments continue to deliver value over time.

These sophisticated systems represent a quantum leap from rule-based automation, incorporating advanced reasoning abilities that enable them to handle ambiguous situations and make contextual decisions in real-time.

The AI agent ecosystem has diversified into four primary categories, each serving distinct business functions. Conversational agents have evolved beyond simple chatbots to become sophisticated dialogue systems capable of handling complex customer interactions, technical support, and even internal knowledge management. Workflow agents orchestrate entire business processes, automatically routing tasks, managing approvals, and coordinating between different systems and departments. Predictive agents analyze vast datasets to forecast trends, identify risks, and recommend proactive measures, while hybrid systems combine multiple agent types to create comprehensive automation solutions that can handle end-to-end business scenarios.

The technical architecture underlying modern AI agents integrates cutting-edge natural language processing capabilities with advanced machine learning models and robust integration APIs. These systems leverage transformer-based language models for understanding context and intent, while machine learning algorithms continuously improve performance based on historical data and user feedback. The integration layer ensures seamless connectivity with existing enterprise systems, enabling AI agents to access real-time data and execute actions across multiple platforms without disrupting established workflows.

Leading companies across industries have already demonstrated the transformative potential of AI agents. Technology giants like Microsoft have implemented AI agents for automated code review and deployment processes, reducing development cycle times by up to 40 percent. Financial institutions utilize AI agents for fraud detection and risk assessment, processing thousands of transactions per second with accuracy rates exceeding 99 percent. Manufacturing companies deploy AI agents for predictive maintenance, preventing equipment failures and optimizing production schedules based on real-time operational data.

Despite their proven capabilities, several misconceptions persist among automation enthusiasts. Many believe AI agents require extensive technical expertise to implement, when modern platforms offer low-code and no-code solutions that democratize access to intelligent automation. Others worry about job displacement, failing to recognize that AI agents primarily augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. Technical barriers such as data integration challenges and system compatibility concerns are increasingly addressed through standardized APIs and cloud-based deployment options that simplify implementation processes.

Business Efficiency Transformation Through AI Agents

The efficiency gains achieved through AI agent implementation are both measurable and substantial across diverse industry sectors. Recent studies indicate that organizations implementing comprehensive AI agent solutions experience an average productivity increase of 35 to 50 percent within the first year of deployment. Manufacturing companies report reductions in operational downtime by up to 25 percent, while service-based businesses see customer response times decrease by an average of 60 percent. These improvements translate directly to bottom-line benefits, with most organizations achieving return on investment within 8 to 12 months of implementation.

The transformation from reactive to proactive business operations represents perhaps the most significant shift enabled by AI agents. Traditional automation systems respond to events after they occur, while AI agents anticipate needs and take preemptive action based on predictive analytics and pattern recognition. This proactive approach enables businesses to address issues before they impact operations, optimize resource allocation based on demand forecasting, and maintain consistent service quality even during peak periods or unexpected disruptions.

Cost reduction strategies through AI agent implementation extend beyond simple labor savings to encompass comprehensive operational optimization. Organizations typically see reductions in processing errors by 70 to 90 percent, eliminating costly mistakes and rework cycles. Energy consumption decreases through intelligent resource management, while inventory costs drop through improved demand forecasting and automated supply chain coordination. When calculating ROI, successful implementations consider not only direct cost savings but also revenue increases from improved customer satisfaction and faster time-to-market for new products or services.

Real-world case studies demonstrate the versatility of AI agent applications across industries. A leading automotive manufacturer deployed AI agents to optimize production scheduling, resulting in 15 percent increase in output capacity without additional equipment investment. A major financial services provider implemented AI agents for loan processing, reducing approval times from days to hours while improving risk assessment accuracy. Healthcare systems utilize AI agents for patient scheduling and resource allocation, achieving 30 percent improvement in facility utilization rates and significant reductions in patient wait times.

Measuring AI agent impact requires a comprehensive assessment framework that goes beyond traditional productivity metrics. Key performance indicators should include process completion rates, accuracy improvements, customer satisfaction scores, and employee engagement levels. Organizations should establish baseline measurements before implementation and track progress through regular performance reviews. Advanced analytics platforms can provide real-time dashboards showing AI agent performance across multiple dimensions, enabling continuous optimization and demonstrating ongoing value to stakeholders.

Implementation Strategies and Best Practices

Successful AI agent deployment requires a structured approach that begins with comprehensive business process analysis and clear objective definition. The implementation roadmap starts with identifying high-impact use cases where AI agents can deliver immediate value while building organizational confidence in the technology. Organizations should prioritize processes that involve repetitive tasks, require real-time decision making, or handle large volumes of data, as these scenarios typically yield the highest returns on AI agent investment.

Technology stack selection plays a crucial role in implementation success, with cloud-based platforms offering the most flexibility and scalability for growing organizations. Modern AI agent platforms provide pre-built integrations with popular enterprise systems, reducing implementation complexity and time-to-value. Organizations should evaluate platforms based on integration capabilities, scalability potential, security features, and vendor support quality. Hybrid cloud deployments often provide the optimal balance between performance and control, allowing sensitive data processing on-premises while leveraging cloud resources for computational intensive tasks.

Change management strategies must address both technical and cultural aspects of AI agent adoption. Technical teams require training on new platforms and integration procedures, while end-users need support understanding how AI agents will enhance their daily workflows. Successful implementations often utilize pilot programs that demonstrate value in low-risk environments before scaling to mission-critical processes. Clear communication about AI agent capabilities and limitations helps set realistic expectations and builds trust among stakeholders who may be skeptical about automation technologies.

Security, compliance, and governance frameworks become increasingly important as AI agents handle sensitive business data and make autonomous decisions. Organizations must implement robust access controls, audit trails, and data encryption to protect against security breaches and ensure regulatory compliance. Governance frameworks should define clear boundaries for AI agent decision-making authority, establish escalation procedures for complex scenarios, and maintain human oversight mechanisms for critical business processes.

Common implementation pitfalls include insufficient data preparation, unrealistic timeline expectations, and inadequate change management planning. Organizations often underestimate the time required for data cleansing and integration, leading to delays and suboptimal AI agent performance. Setting overly aggressive implementation timelines can result in rushed deployments that fail to deliver expected results. Automation leaders recommend starting with well-defined pilot projects, investing adequate time in data preparation, and maintaining realistic expectations about implementation timelines and initial performance levels.

Future-Proofing Your Business with AI Agents in 2025

Emerging trends in AI agent technology point toward increasingly sophisticated capabilities that will reshape business automation in the coming years. Multi-modal AI agents that can process text, images, audio, and video simultaneously will enable more comprehensive automation scenarios, from quality control inspections to customer service interactions.

Implementation Strategies for AI Agent for Testing Success

Successful implementation of AI agents for testing requires a strategic approach that considers technical, organizational, and cultural factors. The journey begins with a comprehensive assessment of existing QA processes, identifying areas where AI agents can provide immediate value while establishing a foundation for long-term transformation.

The step-by-step integration roadmap starts with pilot projects targeting high-maintenance test suites or repetitive testing scenarios. Begin by selecting a single application or testing domain where AI agents can demonstrate clear value. This approach allows teams to gain experience with the technology while minimizing risk and disruption to existing processes. The pilot phase should focus on tools that integrate seamlessly with current testing frameworks, allowing for gradual adoption rather than wholesale replacement.

During the initial implementation phase, establishing clear success metrics is crucial. Define baseline measurements for test maintenance time, defect detection rates, and testing cycle duration. These metrics will demonstrate ROI and guide expansion decisions. The pilot should run for at least three months to allow AI models sufficient time to learn application patterns and demonstrate self-healing capabilities.

Training AI models on specific application context requires careful attention to data quality and representativeness. AI agents learn from historical test results, user behavior data, and application telemetry. Ensure training datasets include diverse scenarios, edge cases, and failure patterns. The quality of AI agent performance directly correlates with the quality and comprehensiveness of training data. Involve domain experts in the training process to validate AI-generated test scenarios and provide feedback that improves model accuracy.

Common pitfalls during deployment include over-reliance on AI agents without human oversight, insufficient training data, and resistance to change from QA teams. Avoid the temptation to replace human testers entirely. Instead, focus on augmenting human capabilities with AI intelligence. Establish clear governance processes for AI-generated tests, including human review of critical test scenarios and regular validation of AI decisions.

Team transition strategies must address both technical skills and mindset changes. Manual testers need upskilling in AI concepts, data analysis, and strategic testing approaches. Provide comprehensive training programs that combine theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. Create new roles that leverage human creativity and domain expertise while working alongside AI agents. Focus on developing skills in test strategy, exploratory testing, and AI agent management rather than repetitive test execution.

The cultural shift requires strong leadership support and clear communication about how AI agents enhance rather than replace human capabilities. Address concerns about job displacement by demonstrating how AI frees testers to focus on higher-value activities like test strategy, user experience validation, and complex scenario design.

Budget considerations should account for both direct tool costs and indirect implementation expenses. AI testing agent platforms typically require subscription fees that scale with usage, but the ROI calculation must include reduced maintenance costs, faster release cycles, and improved quality outcomes. Factor in training costs, infrastructure requirements, and potential consulting services during the evaluation process.

ROI calculation frameworks should consider both quantitative and qualitative benefits. Quantitative measures include reduced testing time, lower defect escape rates, and decreased maintenance overhead. Qualitative benefits encompass improved team morale, enhanced product quality, and faster time-to-market. Most organizations see positive ROI within 6-12 months, with cumulative benefits increasing significantly over time as AI models become more sophisticated.

Exploratory testing, long considered the exclusive domain of human testers, is being revolutionized by AI agents that can simulate user curiosity and discover unexpected application behaviors. These agents employ reinforcement learning to explore application states systematically while identifying anomalies and edge cases that manual testing might miss.

AI agents excel at handling dynamic content and complex user workflows that traditional automation struggles with. They can navigate applications with changing layouts, adapt to personalized user experiences, and test features that depend on real-time data or machine learning recommendations. This capability is particularly valuable for testing modern applications with dynamic UIs and AI-driven features.

Integration with CI/CD pipelines represents a fundamental shift toward continuous intelligent testing. AI agents can analyze code commits, understand the scope of changes, and automatically generate appropriate test suites. They prioritize tests based on risk assessment, ensuring critical paths receive immediate validation while optimizing overall pipeline execution time. Advanced implementations include AI agents that can automatically approve low-risk changes while flagging complex modifications that require human review.

The integration extends beyond simple test execution to intelligent quality gates. AI agents analyze test results, system performance, and user feedback to make deployment decisions. They can predict the likelihood of production issues based on test outcomes and historical patterns, providing confidence scores for release decisions.

Predictive quality insights represent the evolution from reactive to proactive quality assurance. AI agents analyze code complexity, developer patterns, and historical defect data to identify potential hotspots before issues manifest. These insights enable targeted testing efforts and proactive code reviews, preventing defects rather than finding them after introduction.

Machine learning models trained on vast datasets of code changes and defect patterns can predict with remarkable accuracy which components are most likely to contain bugs. This predictive capability enables QA teams to allocate testing resources more effectively and developers to apply additional scrutiny to high-risk code areas.

Cross-browser and cross-device testing orchestration at scale showcases the operational advantages of AI agents. These systems can simultaneously execute thousands of test scenarios across diverse configurations, using machine learning to optimize resource utilization and minimize execution time. AI agents understand browser-specific behaviors and automatically adjust test expectations for different rendering engines while maintaining consistent validation logic.

The orchestration capability extends to intelligent device selection, where AI agents analyze application usage patterns to identify the most important device configurations for testing. This optimization ensures comprehensive coverage while managing the complexity and cost of extensive device testing.

Compliance and regulatory testing automation addresses critical needs in specialized industries like healthcare, finance, and aviation. AI agents trained on regulatory requirements can generate comprehensive compliance test suites and maintain documentation trails required for audits. They understand regulatory frameworks and can adapt testing approaches as requirements evolve.

These specialized AI agents stay current with regulatory changes through continuous learning from compliance databases and industry publications. They can automatically update test procedures when regulations change and generate compliance reports that satisfy auditor requirements.

Emerging trends point toward even more autonomous testing systems. Autonomous bug fixing represents the next frontier, where AI agents not only detect defects but also generate and validate fixes for certain categories of issues. These systems can handle routine bugs like null pointer exceptions, formatting errors, and simple logic mistakes, allowing human developers to focus on complex architectural and business logic issues.

Self-optimizing test suites continuously evolve based on application changes, user behavior, and defect patterns. These advanced systems automatically retire obsolete tests, generate new scenarios for enhanced features, and rebalance test coverage as applications mature. The result is testing infrastructure that maintains maximum effectiveness with minimal human intervention.

The future of AI agents for testing includes integration with development tools, automatic generation of test documentation, and even participation in design reviews to identify potential quality issues before code implementation begins. These systems will become integral partners in the software development lifecycle, providing continuous quality intelligence that enables faster, more reliable software delivery.

As AI agents for testing continue to evolve, they promise to transform quality assurance from a bottleneck into a competitive advantage, enabling organizations to deliver higher-quality software at unprecedented speed while reducing costs and complexity.

Companies implementing AI in test automation are achieving unprecedented cost reductions of up to 60% while simultaneously improving software quality and accelerating release cycles. This isn't theoretical anymore – it's happening right now across Fortune 500 companies and innovative startups alike. Yet despite these remarkable outcomes, many organizations remain trapped in outdated testing approaches that drain resources and slow innovation. Traditional test automation, once the gold standard, is struggling to keep pace with modern development cycles. The result? Costly bottlenecks that burden organizations with millions in delayed releases, overwhelming manual testing overhead, and defects that slip through to production. The pressure is mounting as businesses demand faster delivery without compromising quality, creating an impossible equation for QA teams using yesterday's tools. The solution lies in understanding and implementing the specific AI technologies that are transforming test automation from a necessary cost center into a strategic advantage. This article will guide you through the proven frameworks, implementation strategies, and cutting-edge AI capabilities that leading organizations use to revolutionize their QA operations and achieve measurable ROI in 2025.

The AI Test Automation Revolution - Understanding the 60% Cost Reduction

The transformation happening in software testing right now isn't just evolutionary - it's revolutionary. Companies implementing AI-driven test automation are witnessing cost reductions that seemed impossible just a few years ago, with industry leaders consistently reporting savings between 50-70% in their overall QA expenses. This dramatic shift stems from three fundamental improvements that AI brings to the testing landscape.

First, intelligent test generation eliminates the manual effort traditionally required to create comprehensive test suites. Where teams once spent weeks writing individual test cases, AI algorithms now analyze application behavior, user journeys, and code patterns to generate thousands of relevant tests in hours. A recent implementation at a major e-commerce platform saw their test creation time drop from 240 hours per release cycle to just 15 hours, while simultaneously increasing test coverage from 65% to 92%.

The second major cost driver is maintenance automation through self-healing capabilities. Traditional automated tests break constantly as applications evolve, requiring substantial maintenance overhead. AI-powered testing platforms now automatically adapt to UI changes, updated APIs, and modified business logic without human intervention. One Fortune 500 financial services company reported that their test maintenance burden decreased by 80% after implementing self-healing test scripts, freeing their QA engineers to focus on exploratory testing and complex scenario validation.

Labor reduction represents the third pillar of cost savings, but it's important to understand this doesn't mean job elimination - it means role evolution. QA professionals are shifting from repetitive test execution to strategic test design and quality engineering. Teams are becoming more productive and valuable to their organizations while handling exponentially larger application portfolios.

The cost structure comparison reveals stark differences across testing approaches. Manual testing typically costs $85-120 per hour including overhead, traditional automation requires significant upfront investment plus 30-40% ongoing maintenance costs, while AI-powered testing shows initial setup costs followed by dramatically lower operational expenses. Organizations with 10+ person QA teams see break-even points within 6-8 months, while larger enterprises often achieve positive ROI within the first quarter.

Industry benchmarks indicate that small teams of 3-5 testers can expect 45-55% cost reductions, medium teams of 6-15 testers typically see 55-65% savings, and large enterprises with 15+ testers consistently achieve 60-70% cost reductions. These numbers aren't projections - they're based on actual implementations tracked over 12-18 month periods.

Core AI Technologies Transforming Test Automation in 2025

The technological foundation enabling these cost savings rests on five interconnected AI capabilities that have matured significantly over the past two years. Understanding these technologies helps teams make informed decisions about platform selection and implementation strategies.

Machine learning algorithms now excel at intelligent test case generation and prioritization. These systems analyze code changes, user behavior patterns, and historical defect data to automatically create test scenarios that maximize defect detection probability while minimizing execution time. Advanced ML models can predict which areas of an application are most likely to contain bugs based on recent changes, automatically prioritizing test execution to catch critical issues early in the development cycle.

The sophistication of these algorithms has reached a point where they often identify edge cases that human testers miss. A recent case study from a healthcare software company showed their AI system generated test cases that caught 23% more critical bugs than their previous manual and scripted automated testing combined. The system learned from production incidents to create preventive test scenarios, effectively turning past failures into future protections.

Natural Language Processing has revolutionized how teams create and maintain test documentation. Modern NLP systems can read requirement documents, user stories, and acceptance criteria written in plain English and automatically generate corresponding test cases. This capability eliminates the translation barrier between business requirements and technical test implementation, reducing both time and errors in the process.

More advanced NLP implementations enable teams to describe test scenarios conversationally. Instead of writing complex code, testers can input descriptions like ""verify that premium users can access advanced analytics dashboard after successful login"" and the system generates executable test automation code. This democratizes test creation, allowing product managers and business analysts to contribute directly to test coverage without technical expertise.

Computer vision and visual AI have solved one of automation's most persistent challenges - brittle UI selectors. Traditional automation fails when developers change element IDs, class names, or layout structures. Visual AI systems understand interfaces the way humans do - by recognizing buttons, forms, menus, and content regardless of underlying HTML structure. This approach creates dramatically more resilient test automation that survives interface changes without modification.

The latest visual AI implementations can even perform cross-browser and cross-device testing by recognizing that the same functional element may render differently across platforms while maintaining identical purpose. A login button appears visually consistent to users whether viewed on Chrome, Firefox, mobile Safari, or native mobile applications, and AI systems now match this human-like recognition capability.

Predictive analytics capabilities have transformed test maintenance from reactive to proactive. AI systems analyze test execution patterns, failure rates, and code change histories to predict which tests are likely to become flaky or obsolete. This enables teams to address maintenance issues before they impact productivity, and to optimize test suites by removing redundant or low-value test cases while strengthening coverage in high-risk areas.

Self-healing test capabilities represent the culmination of these technologies working together. When an AI testing system encounters a test failure, it doesn't simply report the failure - it investigates whether the failure represents a genuine bug or an environmental change. If the system determines that a UI element has moved or changed appearance without functional impact, it automatically updates the test to reflect the new reality and continues execution.

Implementation Strategies - From Pilot to Production Scale

Successful AI test automation implementation requires a systematic approach that balances ambition with pragmatism. The most successful organizations follow a phased adoption strategy that builds confidence and competency incrementally rather than attempting wholesale transformation overnight.

The pilot phase should focus on high-impact, low-risk scenarios that demonstrate clear value quickly. Ideal pilot candidates include regression test suites for stable application areas, API testing for well-defined interfaces, and smoke test automation for critical user journeys. These areas typically show immediate ROI while giving teams time to develop expertise with AI testing tools and methodologies.

A successful pilot implementation at a mid-size SaaS company began with automating their user registration and login flows using AI-powered visual testing. Within six weeks, they had replaced 40 manual test cases with self-maintaining automated scenarios that executed in minutes rather than hours. The quick win built organizational confidence and secured budget for broader implementation.

Tool selection represents a critical decision point that significantly impacts long-term success. Modern AI testing platforms vary dramatically in their approaches, capabilities, and integration requirements. Key evaluation criteria should include learning curve requirements for existing team members, compatibility with current development toolchains, scalability to handle projected growth, and transparency in AI decision-making processes.

The most successful implementations choose platforms that augment rather than replace existing team skills. Tools requiring extensive machine learning expertise create adoption barriers and dependency risks. Platforms that enable existing QA professionals to leverage AI capabilities without becoming data scientists tend to show faster adoption and better long-term outcomes.

Building internal competencies requires a balanced approach between upskilling current team members and strategic hiring. Existing QA professionals bring domain knowledge and testing intuition that remains valuable in AI-enhanced environments. However, they need training in AI tool usage, result interpretation, and test strategy adaptation. Most organizations find that 2-3 day intensive workshops followed by mentored hands-on projects create effective skill transition.

Strategic hiring should focus on hybrid professionals who combine testing expertise with AI familiarity rather than pure AI specialists without testing background. Quality engineering roles are evolving to include responsibilities like training data curation, AI model validation, and intelligent test strategy design. These roles require deep testing knowledge enhanced by AI literacy rather than AI expertise applied to testing.

Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines and DevOps workflows must be seamless to achieve full value realization. AI testing platforms should integrate naturally with popular tools like Jenkins, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and AWS CodePipeline. The integration should enable automatic test execution triggered by code commits, intelligent test selection based on change analysis, and real-time result reporting integrated with existing dashboards and notification systems.

Advanced integration implementations include AI-driven deployment decisions where test results influence automated promotion between environments. Systems can learn to recognize patterns in test failures that indicate genuine blocking issues versus environmental inconsistencies, enabling more intelligent automated decision-making in deployment pipelines.

Change management strategies must address both technical and cultural resistance to AI adoption. Technical resistance often stems from concerns about AI reliability, interpretability, and maintenance requirements. Address these concerns through transparent pilot programs, clear documentation of AI decision-making processes, and gradual responsibility transfer that allows teams to build confidence over time.

Cultural resistance typically focuses on job security concerns and skepticism about AI capabilities. Successful change management emphasizes role evolution rather than job replacement, highlighting how AI enables team members to focus on higher-value activities like exploratory testing, test strategy design, and quality engineering. Demonstrate clear career advancement paths in AI-enhanced testing environments.

Measuring Success - KPIs and ROI Metrics for AI Test Automation

Measuring AI test automation success requires a comprehensive metrics framework that captures both immediate operational improvements and long-term strategic value. Traditional testing metrics provide a foundation, but AI implementations demand additional measurements that reflect the unique capabilities and benefits of intelligent automation.

Essential operational metrics focus on direct productivity and quality improvements. Test execution time reduction typically shows the most dramatic improvements, with AI-powered suites often executing 5-10 times faster than traditional automated tests while covering significantly more scenarios. Defect detection rate improvements measure AI's ability to identify bugs that previous testing methods missed, often showing 15-30% increases in critical bug detection during development phases.

Maintenance effort reduction represents one of the most significant long-term value drivers. Track the hours spent on test maintenance activities before and after AI implementation, including time spent updating tests due to application changes, investigating false failures, and managing test environment issues. Successful AI implementations show 60-80% reductions in maintenance overhead within the first year.

Advanced analytics metrics capture the strategic value of AI capabilities. Test coverage optimization measures how effectively AI systems identify and eliminate redundant tests while strengthening coverage in high-risk areas. Rather than simply measuring code coverage percentages, focus on coverage quality - are tests covering the scenarios most likely to contain bugs that impact users?

Prediction accuracy rates measure how effectively AI systems forecast which code changes require testing and which applications areas pose the highest risk. Track the correlation between AI risk predictions and actual defect occurrence over time. Mature AI systems often achieve 80-90% accuracy in predicting which application areas will contain bugs based on code change analysis.

Business impact measurements connect testing improvements to organizational outcomes. Measure changes in production incident frequency and severity, customer-reported bug rates, and time-to-market for new features. While these metrics have multiple contributing factors, AI testing implementations typically show measurable improvements in production stability and release velocity within 6-12 months.

Establishing baselines requires careful data collection before AI implementation begins. Document current test execution times, maintenance effort hours, defect detection rates, and production incident patterns. Many organizations discover they lack comprehensive baseline data, requiring 4-6 weeks of careful measurement before beginning AI implementation.

Long-term trend tracking reveals the compound benefits of AI test automation. Initial implementations often show modest improvements that accelerate over time as AI systems learn from additional data and teams become more proficient with AI-enhanced workflows. Create measurement systems that capture these learning curves and demonstrate continuous improvement trajectories.

Cost-benefit analysis frameworks for AI testing investments must account for both direct cost savings and indirect value creation. Direct savings include reduced labor costs for test creation and maintenance, faster test execution enabling more frequent testing, and reduced production incident response costs. Indirect value includes faster feature delivery cycles, improved product quality leading to better customer satisfaction, and enhanced team productivity enabling larger project portfolios.

Executive dashboards should present AI testing value in business terms rather than technical metrics. Instead of reporting ""test execution time reduced by 75%"", frame results as ""testing bottlenecks eliminated, enabling 40% faster feature delivery"". Connect testing improvements to business outcomes like reduced customer churn due to quality improvements, increased development team productivity, and competitive advantages from faster time-to-market.

The most effective reporting structures combine real-time operational dashboards for technical teams with periodic executive summaries that highlight strategic progress and ROI realization. Technical dashboards should update continuously with current test execution status, AI system performance metrics, and immediate issue alerts. Executive reports should focus on trend analysis, goal achievement, and business impact measurement with quarterly or monthly update cycles.

Creating sustainable measurement practices requires automated data collection and analysis wherever possible. Manual metrics gathering often becomes inconsistent over time, reducing the reliability of ROI calculations. Implement measurement automation that captures key metrics directly from AI testing platforms, CI/CD systems, and incident management tools to ensure consistent, accurate long-term tracking.

For years, the debate has been about which script-based framework is best. But in 2026, the debate itself has changed. Should you stick with traditional test automation, or embrace the new paradigm of Agentic AI?</p><p id="""">As the team at AskUI, we've spent years in the trenches of <strong id="""">web testing</strong>. We’ve seen firsthand how brittle scripts can derail projects and how intelligent automation can save them. This guide provides an updated, in-depth comparison of these two approaches, moving beyond theory to help you choose the right <strong id="""">QA tools</strong> for today's complex web applications.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Old Guard: Why Traditional Automation Still Has a Place</strong></h2><p id="""">Let's be clear: traditional frameworks like Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright are still incredibly powerful. They are mature, have massive community support, and offer granular control for developers who need it.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Selenium:</strong> The long-standing industry standard, known for its flexibility and unrivaled cross-browser support.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cypress:</strong> A favorite among front-end developers for its speed and excellent debugging capabilities in modern JavaScript applications.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Playwright:</strong> A newer powerhouse from Microsoft, praised for its speed, reliability, and features designed to reduce test flakiness.</li></ul><p id="""">These tools are reliable for stable projects. However, they all share a fundamental weakness rooted in their DNA: they are script-based and rely on static selectors. In today's agile world, where UIs change weekly, this leads to a significant and costly problem: constant test maintenance.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Paradigm Shift: Why Agentic AI is the Future of Test Automation</strong></h3><p id="""">This is where Agentic AI enters, representing what many in the industry call a ""quantum leap"" from traditional methods. Instead of blindly following a script, an <strong id="""">Agentic AI</strong> system uses autonomous agents to perceive, reason, and interact with an application, much like a human would.</p><p id="""">Here’s what that means in practice:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">True Adaptability (Self-Healing):</strong> This is the game-changer. Agentic AI doesn't need fragile selectors. It uses computer vision to understand UI elements. So, when your developers change a button's ID but it still visually says ""Submit,"" the test doesn't break. In our experience, this can reduce test maintenance efforts by up to 80-90%.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Smarter Test Creation:</strong> AI agents can analyze an application to dynamically generate test cases, improving coverage and finding edge cases that manual scripting might miss.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Lower Skill Barrier:</strong> Because agents can understand natural language instructions, the heavy reliance on coding is reduced, making <strong id="""">test automation</strong> more accessible to the entire QA team.</li></ul><h2 id="""">‍<strong id="""">Head-to-Head: Traditional vs. Agentic AI for Web Testing</strong></h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><style>

Therefore, on some occasions, you may want to know your screen size to e.g. properly scroll or swipe within your application. You may need to change the numbers for the <strong id="""">input swipe</strong> command within the provided test code so that it suits the screen size of your device.</p><p id="""">3) <strong id="""">Try to select the elements by their text</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><em id="""">tip: If you are using a device with a bigger screen e.g. Tablet, then the screen of your test device (real Android device or emulator) might be big enough to see the whole page without scrolling.</em></li></ul><h3 id="""">1.

From automatically organizing photos to scheduling recurring calendar events and backing up important notes, the use cases span productivity, communication, entertainment, and beyond. For enterprises, this means QA teams can automate complex multi-app user journeys. For individuals, it means reclaiming hours spent on repetitive mobile tasks.</p><p id="""">But in a crowded field of automation tools and AI agents, why should you choose <a href=""https://www.notion.so/26c19a9494f880c2881df78b0a768f13?pvs=21"" id="""">AskUI</a> to automate your Android phone? We constantly challenge ourselves with this exact question. Rather than relying on marketing claims, we sought a quantitative, objective answer.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That's why we're excited to announce: </strong><a href=""https://github.com/askui/askui"" id=""""><strong id="""">AskUI Vision Agent</strong></a><strong id=""""> has achieved 2nd place on the AndroidWorld benchmark, with a task completion rate of 94.8% .</strong></p><p id="""">This is a validation that our vision-first approach to UI automation, powered by our <a href=""https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/tutorial-automate-web-search-on-android-devices-with-askui"" id="""">Android Vision Agent</a>, delivers real-world results on one of the most challenging mobile automation benchmarks available.</p><h2 id="""">What is AndroidWorld?</h2><p id=""""><a href=""https://google-research.github.io/android_world/"" id="""">AndroidWorld</a> is a comprehensive benchmark environment developed by Google Research specifically for evaluating autonomous agents on Android devices. In total, it consists of 116 &nbsp;tasks spanning various domains, such as communication, productivity, entertainment, utilities, and system operations. These tasks represent multi-step workflows that require the agent to navigate across multiple apps, extract relevant information, and interact with dynamic UIs. As AndroidWorld maintains a public <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cchzP9dlTZ3WXQTfYNhh3avxoLipqHN75v1Tb86uhHo/edit?gid=0#gid=0"" id="""">leaderboard</a> it is a great opportunity for us to challenge our Android Vision Agent against the systems of other research teams and companies.</p><h2 id="""">What is the AskUI Vision Agent?</h2><p id="""">We are a small tech startup from Germany. We have developed a <a href=""https://github.com/askui/askui"" id="""">library</a> that allows for reliable, automated end-to-end-automation that only depends on what is shown on your screen instead of the technology or platform you are running on. One core feature of the library is our <a href=""https://docs.askui.com/01-tutorials/01-your-first-agent"" id="""">Vision Agent</a>. It is a system that interfaces with modern large language models on one end, and your system through our <a href=""https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/developing-an-automated-ui-controller-using-gpt-agents-and-gpt-4-vision#toc-4.-device-controller:-the-interactive-core"" id="""">AskUI Controller</a> on the other end. It allows to control your desktop, or mobile phone, and hence automate tasks. With support for multiple AI models, multi-platform compatibility, and enterprise-ready features.</p><h2 id="""">How We Run our Vision Agent on AndroidWorld</h2><p id="""">Running our <a href=""https://docs.askui.com/01-tutorials/01-your-first-agent"" id="""">Vision Agent</a> on AndroidWorld is very straightforward. You can find detailed instructions how to set this system up on your machine in a few minutes in our recent post <a href=""https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/tutorial-automate-web-search-on-android-devices-with-askui"" id="""">here</a>. In contrast to our many competitors, we do <strong id="""">not</strong> use complicated, expensive and slow multi-step pipelines. We believe in starting with simplicity and are convinced that modern state-of-the-art UI Agents can be built on a single AI model when using 1) meaningful prompts, 2) effectively engineered context, and 3) a high-bandwith, precise, and error free interface to OS operations.</p><p id="""">Hence, we use Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 as our reasoning and planning model and our proprietary controller to capture screenshots and handle UI interactions. For each task, Claude analyzes the task, evaluates the state of the UI, and plans what interaction it needs to do next. These interactions range from capturing a screenshot, over execution of touch, or swipe gestures to data entry via keyboard. Our controller will then execute these interactions pixel-precise on the UI.</p><p id="""">As we found Claude 4.5 to occasionally refuse the execution of a task without obvious reason, we use its less capable but more robust predecessor Claude 4.0 as a fallback in these situations (we indicate these tasks with an asterix in the overview below).</p><h2 id="""">What We Found: ~95% Success Rate</h2><p id="""">Our Android Vision Agent <strong id="""">completed 108 of AndroidWorld’s 116 tasks successfully</strong>, securing us second place on the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cchzP9dlTZ3WXQTfYNhh3avxoLipqHN75v1Tb86uhHo/edit?gid=0#gid=0"" id="""">leaderboard</a>! While this proves, that our agent is capable of navigating UIs effectively and of accomplishing tasks at human level, we see this only as the starting point and not as the finish line. Through our analysis, we identified a key challenge: <strong id="""">tasks involving dynamic or rapidly changing UIs</strong>. When screen content changes between the moment our agent captures a screenshot and when it executes an action, the visual context becomes stale. These scenarios create a timing mismatch in our perception-action loop. We're actively working on solutions, including faster screenshot-to-action cycles, predictive UI state modeling, and more robust handling of transient UI elements.</p><h3 id="""">Full Results Overview</h3><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><table border=""1"" style=""width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left;"">

These include identifiers like <code id="""">id</code>, <code id="""">class</code>, or XPath, which must be kept consistent for tests to remain reliable.</p><p id="""">In modern UI development environments, especially those powered by LLMs or no-code platforms, layouts and element structures can change frequently. This leads to increased test failures and high maintenance overhead when using selector-based automation tools.</p><h2 id="""">How AskUI Uses a Visual-First Approach</h2><p id="""">AskUI offers a fundamentally different method: it automates UI tasks by visually interpreting the screen, similar to how a human would. Instead of relying on DOM structures or internal code, it interacts with visible UI components based on pixel and text recognition.</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><style>

One of the emerging technologies at the forefront of this transformation is Vision Agents—tools that leverage visual understanding to streamline workflows and enhance efficiency. Let’s explore how this innovative approach is reshaping automation.</p><h2>What Are Vision Agents?</h2><p>Vision Agents are intelligent systems designed to interpret, process, and act on visual information, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or images. Instead of relying on traditional rule-based logic, Vision Agents use advanced visual understanding techniques to interact with applications the same way humans do—by observing and responding to what they see on the screen.<br><br>By mimicking human vision, these agents have the potential to carry out repetitive and complex tasks across diverse platforms without requiring underlying access to application code or APIs.</p><h2>How Vision Agents Enhance Business Processes</h2><p>1. <strong>Automating Repetitive Tasks</strong>: Vision Agents can quickly learn to perform repetitive tasks like form filling, data extraction, or navigating software applications. By automating these processes, organizations can reduce manual errors, boost productivity, and free up employees to focus on higher-value activities.</p><p>2. <strong>Improving Workflow Efficiency</strong>: By visually understanding interfaces and automating interactions, Vision Agents streamline workflows that might otherwise require custom integrations or manual oversight. This efficiency benefits industries that rely on software-intensive processes, such as finance, healthcare, and retail.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>3. <strong>Overcoming Integration Limitations</strong>: Traditional automation often depends on APIs or custom scripts, limiting flexibility and scalability. Vision Agents bypass these limitations by directly interacting with the visual layer of an application, enabling automation in systems without API access or outdated software environments.</p><h2>Key Benefits of Vision Agents</h2><ul><li><strong>Human-like Precision:</strong> These agents act in ways that mimic human interaction with screens, ensuring more accurate decision-making even in visually complex applications.</li><li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Vision Agents can adapt to dynamic user interfaces, making them suitable for modern applications that frequently change or update.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Once trained, these systems can be deployed across multiple use cases or platforms, scaling operations with ease.</li></ul><h2>The Role of Intelligent Vision in Future Business Innovation</h2><p>As automation solutions continue to evolve, intelligent technologies like Vision Agents are bridging the gap between systems and interfaces that were previously challenging to integrate. These advancements not only improve process efficiency but also enable businesses to deliver better services and customer experiences. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With their ability to bring intelligent vision into business processes, Vision Agents represent a powerful tool for automation. By harnessing visual understanding, organizations can redefine their workflows, gaining efficiency and scalability in the ever-evolving digital landscape.<br></p>","Discover how Vision Agents are transforming automation with human-like visual understanding.

This approach is critical for <strong id="""">""Vibe Coders""</strong> and AI app builders who prioritize speed and efficiency but need to guarantee reliability.</p><h2 id="""">Why Do Vibe Coders Need Automated QA in 2025?</h2><p id="""">Vibe Coders and AI app builders often face a critical challenge: their rapidly assembled applications, while quick to launch, frequently raise concerns about underlying quality, security, and user trust. Users are increasingly hesitant to adopt apps that lack a demonstrable <strong id="""">""Stamp of Quality.""</strong> Automated QA directly addresses these concerns. By 2025, minor UI issues or broken workflows can lead to significant user abandonment—around <strong id="""">70% of mobile app users abandon an app within the first week</strong> if initial experiences are poor. Automated QA provides a verifiable, objective report of an app's quality, fostering user confidence and satisfying stakeholder demands for robust, reliable products.</p><h2 id="""">How Does Automated QA Work for AI-Built Applications?</h2><p id="""">Automated QA for AI-built applications primarily involves leveraging specialized tools that can understand and interact with your application's user interface (UI) and underlying logic without extensive manual scripting. These tools simulate user interactions, identify anomalies, and generate comprehensive reports. For instance, <strong id="""">our new chat</strong> acts as a personal AI test engineer, automatically validating your app’s UI. It interprets natural language test commands, automates interactions across various operating systems, and integrates with existing development workflows like PyTest.</p><h2 id="""">What Core Problems Does Automated QA Solve for AI App Builders?</h2><p id="""">Automated QA directly tackles the common pain points experienced by AI app builders:</p><ul id=""""><li><strong id="""">Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> AI-generated code can inadvertently introduce security flaws (e.g., SQL injections, cross-site scripting, secrets leakage). Automated security testing, often integrated into QA, can flag these issues early.</li><li><strong id="""">Quality &amp; Stability Concerns:</strong> Rapid development can lead to logical errors, broken UI elements, or unexpected behavior. Automated UI and end-to-end tests catch these inconsistencies.</li><li><strong id="""">Lack of User Trust:</strong> Without a verifiable quality assurance process, users may perceive AI-generated apps as less reliable. Automated QA provides the <strong id="""">""Stamp of Quality""</strong> needed to build user trust from day one.</li><li><strong id="""">Performance Bottlenecks:</strong> AI models often prioritize correctness over efficiency, potentially resulting in slower applications.

Tools designed for this purpose analyze your app's interface and workflows, generating factual quality reports, including pixel-level UI checks, workflow success/failure logs, and annotated screenshots.</p><h2 id="""">How Can Our New Feature Provide Assurance for My App?</h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Our new feature</strong> offers a significant advantage for Vibe Coders and AI app builders seeking quality assurance. This <strong id="""">new feature</strong> functions as an AI test engineer, providing a <strong id="""">""Stamp of Quality""</strong> by automatically validating your app's UI so your users trust it from day one.</p><p id="""">Here's how it helps:</p><ul id=""""><li><strong id="""">Natural Language Testing:</strong> You can provide test commands in plain English (e.g., ""click on the 'Sign Up' button,"" ""type 'test@example.com' into the email field"").</li><li><strong id="""">Multi-OS Automation:</strong> It automates UI interactions across Windows, macOS, Linux, and even mobile platforms, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the operating environment.</li><li><strong id="""">Visual Validation:</strong> This system performs pixel-level visual analysis and UI understanding using computer vision, acting like a human user to verify elements and workflows, ensuring what users see is what they expect.</li><li><strong id="""">Comprehensive Reporting:</strong> It generates detailed, visual test reports with pass/fail logs, annotated screenshots, and machine-readable JSON or PDF outputs, seamlessly integrating into your CI/CD pipeline.</li><li><strong id="""">Integration with PyTest:</strong> For developers who prefer a code-based approach, it integrates with PyTest, allowing for robust and maintainable test automation workflows.</li></ul><p id="""">This means you can swiftly verify multi-OS behavior, generate visual proofs for stakeholders, and gain confidence in every deploy, all without extensive manual setup or complex scripting.</p><h2 id="""">What's the Fastest Way to Get Started with Automated QA for My AI App?</h2><p id="""">The fastest way to get started with automated QA for your AI-generated app in 2025 is to leverage zero-setup or low-code AI-powered visual testing tools. These tools minimize the initial configuration time, allowing you to focus on defining your app's critical user flows rather than complex scripting.</p><p id="""">Here’s a general zero-setup workflow:</p><ol start=""1"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Select an AI-Powered QA Tool:</strong> Choose a tool that supports visual and natural language-based automation.</li><li><strong id="""">Install the Vision Agent:</strong> Most modern visual testing tools require a lightweight ""agent"" or ""runner"" installed on the machine where your application will be tested. This typically takes minutes.</li><li><strong id="""">Define Key User Workflows:</strong> Using natural language, describe the essential user journeys in your app (e.g., ""sign up for an account,"" ""add item to cart and checkout,"" ""log in and view dashboard"").</li><li><strong id="""">Execute Tests:</strong> Trigger the automated tests. The tool will launch your application in a controlled environment and simulate these workflows.</li><li><strong id="""">Review Reports:</strong> Analyze the automatically generated reports, which will highlight any broken UIs, failed workflows, or visual discrepancies.</li><li><strong id="""">Iterate and Refine:</strong> Use the insights from the reports to fix issues in your AI-generated code and re-run tests until all critical paths are validated.</li></ol><p id="""">This approach significantly reduces the time from development to confidently launching a high-quality product.</p><h2 id="""">Comparative Advantage: AI Visual Testing vs. Traditional Methods (2025)</h2><p id="""">Traditional QA methods, like manual testing or scripted DOM-based tests, often fall short for rapidly evolving AI-generated applications due to their fragility and time consumption. AI visual testing, by contrast, offers a superior solution.</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><style>

  1) <b>User Onboarding & Authentication</b> — On the homepage, scroll to the bottom to confirm all sections render; scroll back to the top; locate “Sign in with Google”; attempt to sign in; report whether auth completes, fails, or stalls.<br>
  2) <b>Mobile Shopping & Responsive Design</b> — Navigate to <b>All Products</b>; set viewport to <b>400px</b> width; slowly scroll the entire product list like a shopper; note any overlaps, broken layouts, or text overflow.<br>
  3) <b>Content Discovery & Performance</b> — In desktop view on <b>All Products</b>, scroll to the very bottom; click <b>Load More</b>; measure and report the time (seconds) until new products fully render.<br>
  4) <b>End-to-End Search & Filter</b> — From the homepage, go to <b>All Products</b>; scroll at least two rows; open a specific product (e.g., “Handmade Ceramic Mug”); on the detail page verify title, image, price are visible; go back; search for <b>“ceramic”</b>; apply the <b>$51–$100</b> price filter; verify only items in that range appear.<br>
  5) <b>Information Architecture & Footer Navigation</b> — Return to the homepage; scroll to the absolute bottom; in the footer, find <b>Shipping &amp; Returns</b> (may be small text); open it and confirm it navigates to the shipping policy page.<br><br>
  For each issue, categorize severity (<b>Critical / Major / Minor</b>), add a suspected root cause, a proposed fix, and attach a screenshot with clear annotations.

Canvas Automation Testing: How to Automate WebGL-Based Websites,automating-webgl-canvas-based-website,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,6634d1b5206868b54db3ada9,FALSE,FALSE,Fri May 03 2024 11:59:49 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 11 2024 11:24:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 11 2024 11:24:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">WebGL-based websites are becoming increasingly popular among web developers looking to create immersive and interactive user experiences. By drawing graphics and animations directly on the canvas, they offer developers a high degree of creative control over the user interface, providing a more flexible and dynamic platform for graphical compositions. They also offer a more interactive user experience, allowing users to interact with graphics and animations in real-time, making canvas automation and testing critical for ensuring the website's functionality.</p><p id="""">However, WebGL-based websites also present a unique challenge for automation and testing, as they often lack DOM elements that conventional selector-based test frameworks rely on.</p><p id="""">In this tutorial, we will demonstrate a canvas automation case using AskUI to automate a WebGL-based website. Since Ask relies solely on what is visible on the screen, you will discover how easy it is to automate even such a canvas-based website without relying on any DOM element.</p><h2 id="""">Visit the Target Website</h2><p id="""">For the demonstration, we will use the website below. First, visit this website. If you inspect the source of this website, you will discover that it consists of a single canvas element without giving any clue on how to programmatically automate user interaction.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><a href=""https://chartogne-taillet.com/en/"" id="""">https://chartogne-taillet.com</a></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Disclaimer</strong>: We use this website merely for our demonstration purpose and don't intend to promote any product or brand from this website.</p><h2 id="""">Plan the Automation</h2><p id="""">Our final goal of this automation is to visit a page of this website that gives detailed information about a certain grapevine. Below are the steps we will automate:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Open the web browser and go to the website.</li><li id="""">Click <em id="""">Accept</em> for the cookie pop-up.</li><li id="""">Click the text <em id="""">Enter</em> on the first page.</li><li id="""">Click the text that is a certain sort of grapevine.</li><li id="""">Move the mouse cursor to the interaction point.</li><li id="""">Scroll the mouse wheel.</li></ol><h2 id="""">1. Visiting the Website</h2><p id="""">The first step of the automation is to open the web browser and go to the website. Use the code below, and adjust the necessary part for your environment:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">After successfully running the code, we will see this page:</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1b5206868b54db3ad9b_6437b3329cb0e18f5ed49986_webgl-first.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">2. Click Enter and go to Les Couarres</h2><p id="""">Nextly, we will click the text <em id="""">Enter</em> and the page will transit to the next page. After that, we press the text <em id="""">Les Couarres</em> on the bottom right part of the page. Note that these texts are not DOM elements, but merely texts drawn on the canvas as a bitmap. So there is no clue how to interact with these text-buttons if you inspect the source HTML of the page. Add this code block to the end of the code:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">After running the code, we will be on this page:</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1b5206868b54db3ad93_6437b3683ca99c2efd00df9b_webgl-second.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id="""">3. Scroll on the Text</h2><p id="""">Now we want to move on to the page where we can get detailed information about Les Couarres. To do so, we have to interact with the text <em id="""">DISCOVER</em> that is placed at the mid-bottom of the screen:</p><pre></pre><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1b5206868b54db3ad97_6437b3905fa99b54af48d580_webgl-third.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Try to adjust the amount of scrolling that suits your condition, for example, decrease it to -3000 if you have a high-resolution display. When scrolling on the text, you will see a smooth transition to another page. Clicking the text also triggers the same result, so give it a try if you want to!</p><p id="""">There will be an animation until the page transition gets done. And after the transition, we will be on a page about a certain vineyard and grapes.</p><p id="""">Congratulations! You just successfully automated mouse interactions with WebGL contents!</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">In this article, we demonstrated how to automate a WebGL-based website using AskUI. By relying solely on what is visible on the screen, AskUI can interact with canvas-based websites without requiring any selectors or tags. We walked through an automation/testing case to visit a certain page of a website, click on non-DOM text elements, move the mouse cursor toward a bitmap text, and scroll on a specific bitmap text, all of which are common challenges when automating WebGL-based and canvas-based websites. With AskUI, you can easily automate even the most complex canvas-based user interfaces, providing a more efficient way to test and validate the user experience of your WebGL applications.</p>",WebGL-based websites are becoming increasingly popular among web developers looking to create immersive and interactive user experiences.

The potential applications span various industries, striving to make intelligent agents smarter and more adaptable in the real world. Below are some compelling use cases illustrating this integration at work.</p><h2 id="""">Knowledge-Based Question Answering (KBQA)</h2><p id="""">One of the most exciting applications of neurosymbolic AI is in Knowledge-Based Question Answering (KBQA). Traditional AI systems often struggle with complex natural language queries that involve multiple relations or require reasoning over a wide knowledge base. However, with the potential of neurosymbolic AI, these challenges can be tackled more effectively. The ability to translate queries into logical forms enables intelligent systems to perform reasoning akin to human thought processes. This could revolutionize customer support, business intelligence, and scientific discovery by providing deeper insights and more precise answers to intricate questions.</p><h2 id="""">Common Sense Reasoning in Vision Agents</h2><p id="""">Common sense reasoning remains a frontier where many AI systems fall short. Neurosymbolic AI serves to bridge this gap — particularly with vision agents. The ability to track objects that aren’t always visible, similar to understanding object permanence in human development, exemplifies this. For self-driving vehicles, this means anticipating the trajectory of pedestrians who may be temporarily obscured. In healthcare, robotic assistants equipped with this capability could effectively locate and handle medical equipment in cluttered environments, enhancing operational efficiency and safety.</p><h2 id="""">Natural Language Understanding</h2><p id="""">Neurosymbolic AI also promises significant advances in natural language understanding. By employing semantic parsing, this technology allows AI systems to interpret sentences into logical forms, leading to a more nuanced understanding of human language. This can empower AI assistants to respond to sophisticated requests and enable chatbots to engage in meaningful conversations. The impact is potential enhancement in customer service experiences and personal interactions with AI, fostering more intuitive human-computer interactions.</p><h2 id="""">Accelerating Scientific Discovery</h2><p id="""">The realm of scientific discovery can greatly benefit from the implementation of neurosymbolic AI. Whereas traditional AI systems may lack the nuanced reasoning needed for complex tasks, neurosymbolic AI can integrate domain-specific knowledge to drive innovation. For example, in the design of new materials or in drug development, these intelligent systems could model unknown molecules more accurately, facilitating breakthroughs that can lead to novel solutions in material science and pharmacology.</p><h2 id="""">Expanding Horizons with Neurosymbolic AI</h2><p id="""">The discussed use cases merely scratch the surface of what neurosymbolic AI can achieve. As research progresses and the technology matures, we anticipate an influx of innovative applications in diverse domains, offering solutions that overcome the limitations of traditional AI methods. The integration of symbolic reasoning into intelligent agents could be a game-changer, propelling the development of systems that are not only smarter but also more adaptable to complex, real-world challenges.</p><p id="""">Neurosymbolic AI is poised to redefine our interaction with technology, potentially enabling intelligent agents to process information with an unprecedented depth of understanding. As this field continues to evolve, its impact will likely expand, shaping the future of technology across various disciplines.</p>","The potential applications span various industries, striving to make intelligent agents smarter and more adaptable in the real world.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673b17a0bf047e2e7ee7090b_Designer%20(70).webp,"A highly detailed, futuristic android with illuminated blue eyes is interacting with a transparent digital interface.

These agents use advanced algorithms to interpret, analyze, and act on visual data. This post delves into several examples of vision AI agents, showcasing their diverse applications and the innovative ways they are being used across different domains.</p><h2 id="""">Stable Diffusion and AI Image Analyzers</h2><p id="""">One illustrative example of a vision AI agent is the system using Stable Diffusion for image generation. This configuration involves two primary components: a text-to-image generator and an AI image analyzer. The text-to-image generator produces images based on user prompts, while the AI image analyzer evaluates these images, providing valuable feedback for refinement. Through repeated iterations, this system enhances the quality of generated images. The process illustrates the synergy between creativity and analysis, as continuous feedback loops drive improvements in image generation results.</p><h2 id="""">Vision Language Models (VLMs)</h2><p id="""">Vision Language Models (VLMs) epitomize the next level of AI capabilities by simultaneously processing visual and textual data. These models are adept at recognizing and contextualizing visual information, bridging the gap between images and their textual descriptions. They can generate text-based descriptions from images or create images from given text prompts. VLMs are particularly useful in business applications, where they streamline processes like automating customer support and digitizing invoices, making workflows more efficient and less reliant on human intervention.</p><h2 id="""">AskUI Vision Agent</h2><p id="""">AskUI's Vision agent highlights another frontier of vision AI capabilities. With the ability to control a computer interface through visual input, AskUI can perform tasks such as conducting web research and interacting with digital applications. It simulates human actions like clicking buttons and entering text, effectively acting as a human surrogate for computer interaction. This AI capability advances productivity by automating tasks that typically require direct human engagement, thereby freeing up human resources for more strategic roles.</p><h2 id="""">Automated Vision Tasks</h2><p id="""">In the realm of automation, vision AI agents are crafting pathways for generating Python programs to automate repetitive tasks. A notable application includes analyzing visual data to detect surfers near sharks in video footage. By leveraging AI algorithms to bind visual inputs and detected objects, these agents can automate surveillance and monitoring tasks efficiently, thereby enhancing safety measures and operational accuracy in potentially dangerous environments.</p><h2 id="""">Interactive Computer Control</h2><p id="""">Interactive visions agents are revolutionizing computer control by enabling users to command their systems through visual cues. Workshops have demonstrated these agents in various operating systems like iOS, Linux, and Windows. They enhance productivity through automation processes such as form filling and quality assurance in software testing. By interpreting visual inputs effectively, vision AI agents significantly reduce the time and effort required for repetitive and routine tasks.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">Vision AI agents are revolutionizing numerous fields by offering innovative solutions to both everyday tasks and complex challenges. From augmenting image generation processes to streamlining business operations and improving safety in hazardous scenarios, vision AI agents demonstrate a versatile range of applications, marking significant progress in the capabilities of artificial intelligence systems.</p>",Vision AI agents are revolutionizing numerous fields by offering innovative solutions to both everyday tasks and complex challenges.,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673336f53a53afcafb377147_Designer%20(56).webp,"A humanoid robot is sitting at a desk, using a laptop, surrounded by a futuristic digital interface.

Its strength lies in its extensive library of pre-built connectors, including popular services like Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SAP, and Salesforce. These connectors simplify the process of integrating different systems and automating tasks between them. Power Automate provides a user-friendly, low-code environment where users can design, deploy, and manage automated workflows.</p><h3 id="""">The Desktop Dilemma</h3><p id="""">However, Power Automate encounters difficulties when confronted with desktop applications.&nbsp;While it offers Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities to interact with legacy systems, these are often limited to pre-defined UI actions and may not handle complex desktop workflows effectively.</p><h3 id="""">Visual Automation: AskUI</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">AskUI offers a different approach to desktop automation.</strong> AskUI utilizes the power of AI-driven Vision Agents that interact with desktop applications in a way similar to humans. These Vision Agents can ""see"" elements on the screen and perform actions based on visual cues, making them highly adaptable to various desktop environments. AskUI's Development Kit enables users to create custom Vision Agents that precisely automate even the most intricate desktop workflows.</p><h3 id="""">Looking Forward: A Better Fit?</h3><p id="""">AskUI's focus on visual automation, combined with the flexibility of custom Vision Agents, makes it a strong contender for automating desktop applications. Its intuitive approach may offer a more effective and user-friendly solution for tackling the challenges of desktop automation, particularly in cases where traditional methods struggle.</p>",Power Automate automates workflows across a range of applications.

Especially User Interface (UI) automation can be quite challenging in certain cases. Despite countless frameworks and tools, it is very difficult to automate applications across operating systems, although cross-platform workflows play an increasingly important role. For example, testing a 2-factor authentication of a web application via smartphone is almost impossible to automate as an end-to-end process.</p><p id="""">AskUI closes this gap by rethinking UI automation.</p><h2 id="""">About AskUI</h2><p id="""">AskUI is a platform-independent, visual selector based UI automation framework. Instead of controlling elements via selectors such as <em id="""">XPath</em> or <em id="""">CSS</em> selectors and thus being limited to web applications, AskUI controls the UI at the operating system level while also detecting elements with AI vision models.</p><p id="""">For making this possible, a neural network was trained on the appearance of UI elements in order to localize UI elements based on screenshots. These are then matched with an instruction that is unique for the respective element. The final execution of the instruction happens via mouse and keyboard control on the operating system. Such an instruction could be for example:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">If we take a look at the corresponding UI, it becomes clear which action is to be executed:</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1b9c39f787e903e86af_631f00a03e31e3e9503a3a5f_2jhpm80ee9urmzzwocq8.png"" alt=""Image description"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Example Login page</figcaption></figure><p id="""">The instruction describes a click on a button below a certain text, in this case <em id="""">Password</em>. Visually, there is only one button here, so when the action is executed, a click on the blue <em id="""">Login</em> button is performed.</p><h2 id="""">Why AskUI</h2><p id="""">In principle, one can of course ask whether another test automation tool is needed after Selenium, Playwright and co. If you look at the development of the last few years, you will notice that websites and apps are using more and more new technologies, e.g. <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp"" id="""">iFrame</a> or <a href=""https://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/"" id="""">ShadowDOM</a>, and third-party systems, which make it more difficult to automate them. Instead of developing a separate automation solution for each new technology, AskUI acts independently of these developments and acts as a future-proof framework for UI automation of any operating system. The following advantages result from the approach:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Test instructions are written in <em id="""">UI language</em> and are thus easy to understand.</li><li id="""">No access to code selectors is needed. Thus the tests are independent of changes in the program code and run very stable.</li><li id="""">Elements are found visually by an AI vision model and not by pixel-matching. This makes the automation completely independent of the resolution and design of the UI elements.</li></ul><p id="""">In the following, we will take a look at the first steps in AskUI.</p><h2 id="""">Setting up AskUI</h2><p id="""">AskUI is an <a href=""https://github.com/askui/askui"" id="""">open source framework </a>with a public <a href=""https://docs.askui.com/"" id="""">documentation</a>.

The corporate landscape is experiencing a fundamental shift as AI agents evolve from theoretical concepts to practical business solutions that are revolutionizing how organizations operate. These sophisticated systems are not merely automating routine tasks but are actively transforming entire business processes through intelligent decision-making, predictive capabilities, and autonomous problem-solving. As we advance through 2025, companies across industries are discovering that AI agents represent the next evolutionary step beyond traditional automation, offering unprecedented opportunities to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance competitive advantage.

Intelligent Process Automation - Beyond Traditional RPA

The distinction between AI agents and conventional robotic process automation lies in their cognitive capabilities and adaptive decision-making processes. While traditional RPA systems follow predetermined rules and workflows, AI agents possess the ability to understand context, learn from patterns, and make intelligent decisions based on changing circumstances. These advanced systems integrate machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and neural networks to create a dynamic automation framework that continuously improves its performance.

A compelling case study from JPMorgan Chase demonstrates the transformative power of AI agents in financial services. The bank implemented an AI agent system called COIN (Contract Intelligence) to analyze legal documents and extract key data points from commercial loan agreements. The results were remarkable: what previously required 360,000 hours of work by lawyers and loan officers annually was reduced to mere seconds. The AI agent achieved 99.5% accuracy in document analysis while reducing processing costs by 85% and eliminating human error in contract interpretation.

The technical architecture underlying these AI agents combines several sophisticated components. Machine learning algorithms enable the system to recognize patterns and improve decision-making over time. Natural language processing allows the agents to understand and interpret unstructured text data, while adaptive learning mechanisms ensure the system evolves with changing business requirements. These components work together to create a self-improving automation framework that becomes more valuable as it processes more data.

The financial impact of implementing AI agents extends far beyond simple cost reduction. Organizations typically see a return on investment within 12 to 18 months, with ongoing operational savings of 40-60% in targeted processes. Implementation timelines vary based on complexity, but most enterprises can deploy basic AI agent functionality within 3-6 months, with full optimization achieved within 12 months. The key to success lies in selecting appropriate use cases and ensuring proper integration with existing systems and workflows.

Predictive Analytics and Decision Intelligence Systems

AI agents are revolutionizing business operations through their ability to predict and prevent operational challenges before they impact productivity or customer satisfaction. These systems leverage advanced predictive modeling techniques to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and forecast potential issues across various business functions. The proactive nature of these AI agents represents a paradigm shift from reactive problem-solving to preventive business management.

Industry leaders are witnessing remarkable transformations in predictive maintenance applications. General Electric has implemented AI agents across their manufacturing facilities that monitor equipment performance in real-time, analyzing vibration patterns, temperature fluctuations, and operational metrics to predict mechanical failures weeks before they would typically occur. This predictive approach has reduced unplanned downtime by 70% and maintenance costs by 35%, while extending equipment lifespan by an average of 18 months.

Supply chain optimization represents another frontier where AI agents are delivering exceptional results. Walmart employs sophisticated AI agent systems that analyze weather patterns, consumer behavior data, transportation logistics, and supplier performance to predict demand fluctuations and optimize inventory distribution. These systems can anticipate seasonal trends, regional preferences, and even the impact of external events like natural disasters or economic changes, enabling the company to maintain optimal stock levels while minimizing waste.

Implementation strategies for predictive analytics vary significantly based on business size and industry requirements. Small to medium enterprises can begin with focused applications like inventory forecasting or customer churn prediction, gradually expanding their AI agent capabilities as they demonstrate value and build internal expertise. Larger organizations often benefit from comprehensive deployments that integrate multiple predictive models across various business functions, creating a unified intelligence system that provides holistic operational insights.

Success in predictive analytics requires a structured measurement framework that tracks both technical performance and business impact. Key metrics include prediction accuracy rates, false positive percentages, time-to-insight improvements, and quantifiable business outcomes such as cost savings, revenue increases, or risk reduction. Organizations should establish baseline measurements before AI agent deployment and implement continuous monitoring systems to track improvement over time.

Autonomous Customer Service and Support Operations

The evolution of customer service through AI agents represents one of the most visible and impactful transformations in business operations. These advanced systems go far beyond simple chatbots, incorporating sophisticated natural language understanding, emotional intelligence, and contextual awareness to handle complex customer interactions with human-like proficiency.

The AI Agent Testing Revolution - Why 2025 is the Breakthrough Year

The software testing landscape is undergoing its most significant transformation since the advent of automated testing frameworks. While traditional automation tools have served development teams for decades, 2025 marks the emergence of truly intelligent AI agents for testing that fundamentally change how quality assurance operates. These sophisticated systems represent an evolutionary leap from basic script-based automation to adaptive, learning-capable testing entities that can think, analyze, and optimize their own performance.

Market research reveals a staggering 300% increase in AI testing tool adoption across enterprise organizations in the past eighteen months alone. This explosive growth reflects not just technological curiosity but genuine business necessity. Companies are discovering that conventional testing approaches simply cannot keep pace with modern development cycles, where applications are deployed multiple times daily and user expectations for flawless experiences continue to escalate.

The technological foundation enabling this revolution rests on three critical advances. Natural language processing capabilities now allow AI agents to interpret requirements documentation and user stories directly, translating human intent into comprehensive test scenarios without manual scripting. Computer vision technology enables these agents to interact with applications just as human testers would, identifying and responding to visual elements across different interfaces and platforms. Meanwhile, sophisticated machine learning algorithms continuously analyze testing patterns, failure modes, and application behavior to optimize testing strategies in real-time.

The contrast between traditional and AI-powered methodologies becomes stark when examining their operational characteristics. Traditional automation requires extensive upfront scripting, manual maintenance when applications change, and rigid execution paths that often miss edge cases. AI agents for testing, conversely, generate test cases dynamically, adapt automatically to interface modifications, and discover unexpected testing scenarios through exploratory analysis. Where conventional tools execute predetermined scripts, AI agents think, learn, and evolve their testing approach based on accumulated knowledge and changing application requirements.

Industry leaders who have successfully implemented AI testing agents describe the transformation as revolutionary rather than incremental. Sarah Chen, VP of Engineering at CloudScale Technologies, reports that their AI agent implementation not only reduced testing time by 78% but also discovered critical bugs that their previous automation framework consistently missed. The agents' ability to simulate realistic user behavior patterns and identify subtle interface inconsistencies has elevated their quality assurance from reactive bug detection to proactive quality engineering.

Proven Strategies - How AI Agents Deliver 75% Time Reduction

The dramatic time savings achieved through AI agents for testing stems from four core capabilities that fundamentally reimagine the testing process. Understanding these mechanisms provides insight into why organizations consistently report such substantial efficiency gains when transitioning from traditional automation approaches.

Intelligent test case generation represents perhaps the most transformative capability of modern AI testing agents. Rather than requiring manual script creation, these systems analyze application requirements, user stories, and existing codebase to automatically generate comprehensive test scenarios. The agents examine data flows, user interaction patterns, and business logic to create test cases that often exceed the coverage achieved through manual planning. This automated generation process eliminates weeks of upfront test planning while ensuring more thorough application coverage than human testers typically achieve.

Self-healing test automation addresses one of the most persistent pain points in traditional testing frameworks. When application interfaces change, conventional automated tests frequently break, requiring manual intervention to update selectors, workflows, or validation criteria. AI agents for testing continuously monitor application structure and automatically adapt their interaction methods when changes occur. If a button moves location or changes appearance, the agent recognizes the modification and updates its interaction approach without human intervention. This self-healing capability alone can eliminate 60-80% of test maintenance overhead.

Parallel execution optimization leverages AI-driven orchestration to maximize testing efficiency across available resources. Traditional automation tools typically execute tests sequentially or require manual configuration for parallel execution. AI agents analyze test dependencies, resource requirements, and execution patterns to automatically distribute testing workload across multiple environments simultaneously. The agents intelligently schedule tests to minimize conflicts while maximizing resource utilization, often achieving 5-10x faster execution times than conventional approaches.

Predictive analytics for defect identification transforms quality assurance from reactive bug detection to proactive quality engineering. AI agents continuously analyze code changes, testing patterns, and historical defect data to identify areas most likely to contain issues before testing begins. This predictive capability allows teams to focus testing effort on high-risk areas while maintaining confidence in lower-risk components. The agents learn from each testing cycle, continuously improving their prediction accuracy and enabling increasingly efficient resource allocation.

The cumulative impact of these capabilities creates a synergistic effect where total time reduction exceeds the sum of individual improvements. Organizations typically observe initial time savings of 40-50% within the first month of AI agent implementation, with reductions approaching or exceeding 75% as the systems learn and optimize over subsequent testing cycles. The agents become increasingly efficient as they accumulate knowledge about application behavior, user patterns, and defect characteristics.

Implementation Blueprint - Getting Started with AI Testing Agents

Successfully transitioning to AI agents for testing requires a structured approach that balances technological adoption with team readiness and organizational change management. The implementation journey typically spans 90 days, with each phase building upon previous accomplishments while preparing for subsequent challenges.

The initial assessment phase focuses on evaluating current testing infrastructure and identifying optimal entry points for AI agent integration. Teams begin by auditing existing test suites, documenting current time investments, and establishing baseline metrics for comparison. This assessment reveals which testing scenarios offer the greatest potential for AI enhancement while identifying technical prerequisites and potential integration challenges. Successful implementations typically start with well-defined, stable application areas before expanding to more complex or frequently changing components.

Tool evaluation represents a critical decision point that significantly impacts long-term success. Leading AI agent for testing platforms each offer distinct advantages suited to different organizational contexts. Selenium Grid AI excels in environments with extensive existing Selenium infrastructure, providing seamless migration paths while adding intelligent capabilities. Testim offers sophisticated machine learning algorithms particularly effective for web application testing, with strong natural language processing capabilities for requirement interpretation. Mabl provides comprehensive visual testing capabilities ideal for applications with complex user interfaces, while Applitools focuses on visual AI that excels at detecting subtle interface inconsistencies.

The evaluation framework should assess each platform across multiple dimensions including integration complexity, learning curve requirements, ongoing maintenance overhead, and scalability characteristics. Technical compatibility with existing CI/CD pipelines often proves decisive, as seamless integration enables faster adoption and reduces implementation friction. Teams should also consider the vendor's roadmap alignment with their long-term testing strategy and the availability of professional services to accelerate implementation.

Integration strategies must account for existing development workflows while minimizing disruption to ongoing projects. Most successful implementations adopt a parallel approach, gradually transitioning test suites to AI agents while maintaining existing automation as backup. This strategy provides confidence during the transition period while allowing teams to validate AI agent performance before fully committing to the new approach. Integration typically begins with non-critical test suites, expanding to mission-critical scenarios only after demonstrating reliability and effectiveness.

Team training and skill development requirements vary significantly from traditional automation training. AI agents for testing require understanding of machine learning concepts, data analysis techniques, and algorithmic thinking rather than detailed programming skills. Team members must learn to work collaboratively with AI systems, providing guidance and feedback while trusting the agents to handle routine testing tasks. This shift from manual control to intelligent collaboration often represents the most significant cultural adjustment in AI testing adoption.

ROI calculation templates help organizations track implementation success and justify continued investment in AI testing technologies. Key metrics include test execution time reduction, defect detection improvement, maintenance overhead reduction, and team productivity enhancement. Organizations should also monitor qualitative improvements such as test coverage enhancement, scenario diversity increase, and team satisfaction levels. Most implementations achieve positive ROI within 6-12 months, with benefits continuing to compound as AI agents learn and optimize their performance.

Real-World Case Studies and Measurable Results

The theoretical advantages of AI agents for testing translate into substantial practical benefits across diverse organizational contexts, from Fortune 500 enterprises to innovative startups competing in rapidly evolving markets.

Global financial services leader MegaBank achieved their remarkable 75% QA time reduction through a comprehensive AI agent implementation spanning 18 months.

The AI Agent Revolution - Understanding Intelligent Enterprise Automation

The enterprise landscape is experiencing a fundamental transformation as intelligent agent systems redefine the boundaries of what automated systems can accomplish. Unlike traditional automation tools that follow rigid, pre-programmed rules, AI agents represent a quantum leap forward in autonomous decision-making capabilities. These sophisticated systems don't just execute tasks - they think, learn, and adapt in real-time, making complex decisions that previously required human intervention.

The evolution from simple rule-based bots to cognitive AI agents marks one of the most significant technological shifts in enterprise operations. Where traditional automation required explicit programming for every scenario, modern AI agents leverage machine learning algorithms to understand context, interpret nuance, and respond appropriately to novel situations. This cognitive flexibility allows them to handle the unpredictable nature of real-world business environments with remarkable effectiveness.

Market data for 2025 reveals an explosive growth trajectory in enterprise AI agent adoption. Current statistics show that 78% of Fortune 500 companies have deployed at least one AI agent system, with early adopters reporting productivity increases of up to 40% in supported workflows. The global enterprise AI agent market is projected to reach $47 billion by the end of 2025, representing a 312% increase from 2023 levels. This unprecedented growth reflects the tangible value these systems deliver across diverse operational domains.

Three key differentiators separate modern AI agents from their predecessors. Natural language processing capabilities enable these systems to understand and respond to human communication with unprecedented accuracy, eliminating the need for specialized command languages or rigid interaction protocols. Contextual awareness allows AI agents to consider environmental factors, historical data, and situational nuances when making decisions, resulting in more appropriate and effective responses. Cross-system integration capabilities enable seamless communication between different enterprise platforms, breaking down traditional silos and creating unified operational intelligence.

The practical implications of these capabilities become evident when observing AI agents in action. Modern enterprise AI agents can simultaneously monitor dozens of data streams, identify patterns invisible to human observers, and execute coordinated responses across multiple systems within seconds. This level of operational sophistication represents a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive enterprise management.

Core Enterprise Applications Where AI Agents Excel

Customer service represents one of the most visible and impactful applications of AI agent technology in modern enterprises. Today's intelligent support agents operate 24/7, handling complex customer queries with human-like understanding and empathy. These systems don't simply retrieve predefined responses from knowledge bases - they analyze customer sentiment, understand context and intent, and craft personalized solutions that address both explicit and implicit customer needs. Advanced AI agents can escalate issues appropriately, maintain conversation continuity across multiple touchpoints, and even proactively identify potential problems before customers become aware of them.

Supply chain optimization showcases the predictive power of AI agent systems in managing complex, interconnected business processes. These intelligent agents continuously monitor supplier performance, market conditions, transportation networks, and demand patterns to make autonomous decisions about inventory levels, logistics routing, and vendor relationships. They can predict supply shortages weeks in advance, automatically negotiate contract terms with suppliers, and reroute shipments in real-time to avoid disruptions. The result is a supply chain that adapts dynamically to changing conditions while maintaining optimal efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Financial operations benefit tremendously from AI agent capabilities in fraud detection, compliance monitoring, and automated reporting. These systems analyze transaction patterns, identify anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity, and take immediate protective action without human intervention. For compliance monitoring, AI agents continuously review business processes against regulatory requirements, automatically flagging potential violations and suggesting corrective actions. In reporting functions, they gather data from multiple sources, validate accuracy, and generate comprehensive financial reports with analytical insights that help drive strategic decision-making.

Human resources departments are experiencing a revolution through AI agent implementation in recruitment, onboarding, and employee engagement processes. Recruitment AI agents can screen thousands of resumes, identify top candidates based on nuanced criteria, and conduct initial interviews with remarkable effectiveness. During onboarding, these systems guide new employees through complex procedures, answer questions in real-time, and ensure compliance with organizational policies. For ongoing employee engagement, AI agents monitor satisfaction indicators, identify potential retention risks, and suggest targeted interventions to maintain workforce stability.

IT infrastructure management represents perhaps the most technically sophisticated application of AI agent technology. Self-healing systems powered by AI agents can detect, diagnose, and resolve technical issues faster than traditional monitoring solutions. These agents continuously analyze system performance metrics, predict potential failures before they occur, and automatically implement corrective measures. They manage software updates, optimize resource allocation, and maintain security protocols with minimal human oversight, resulting in dramatically improved system reliability and reduced operational costs.

Implementation Strategies and Best Practices for 2025

Successful AI agent implementation begins with a comprehensive assessment framework that evaluates current enterprise systems for integration readiness. This assessment examines data quality and accessibility, existing API infrastructure, security protocols, and organizational change readiness. Key evaluation criteria include data governance maturity, system interoperability, staff technical competency, and leadership commitment to AI-driven transformation. Organizations must honestly assess these factors before proceeding with implementation to ensure successful deployment outcomes.

The most effective approach to AI agent deployment follows a carefully planned, phased methodology that starts small and scales strategically. Phase one typically focuses on a single, well-defined use case with clear success metrics and limited organizational impact. This pilot phase allows teams to learn essential lessons about system integration, user adoption, and performance optimization without risking critical business operations. Phase two expands to related processes within the same department, leveraging lessons learned to improve deployment efficiency. Subsequent phases gradually extend AI agent capabilities across departments and business functions, building organizational confidence and expertise with each successful expansion.

Integration considerations form the foundation of successful AI agent deployment. API connectivity requirements must be thoroughly mapped to ensure seamless communication between AI agents and existing enterprise systems. Data governance protocols need updating to accommodate AI agent data access requirements while maintaining security and compliance standards. Security protocols must evolve to protect against new threat vectors introduced by AI agent systems while enabling the connectivity these systems require to function effectively. Organizations must also consider bandwidth requirements, processing power needs, and storage capacity to support AI agent operations at scale.

Change management represents one of the most critical success factors in AI agent implementation. Teams require comprehensive training not just on how to use AI agent systems, but on how to collaborate effectively with these intelligent systems. This includes understanding AI agent capabilities and limitations, knowing when to intervene or override agent decisions, and developing workflows that optimize human-AI collaboration. Successful organizations invest heavily in change management programs that address both technical training needs and cultural adaptation to AI-augmented work environments.

ROI measurement requires carefully selected key performance indicators that capture both quantitative and qualitative benefits of AI agent deployment. Quantitative metrics typically include processing time reductions, error rate improvements, cost savings, and throughput increases. Qualitative metrics might encompass employee satisfaction improvements, customer experience enhancements, and strategic capability developments. Organizations should establish baseline measurements before AI agent deployment and track improvements consistently over time to demonstrate value and guide optimization efforts.

Future-Proofing Your Enterprise with Advanced AI Agent Capabilities

Emerging technologies are pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can accomplish in enterprise environments. Multi-modal AI agents that can process text, images, audio, and video simultaneously are enabling more sophisticated understanding of complex business situations. Quantum-enhanced processing capabilities promise to dramatically increase the computational power available to AI agents, enabling real-time analysis of vastly larger datasets. Edge computing integration allows AI agents to operate with reduced latency and improved reliability, particularly important for time-sensitive business processes.

Predictive analytics evolution represents the next frontier in AI agent capabilities. Advanced systems are moving beyond reactive and proactive responses to truly anticipatory behavior. These AI agents analyze subtle patterns in business data to predict needs, opportunities, and challenges before they become apparent through traditional metrics. They can forecast market demand shifts, identify emerging customer preferences, and predict equipment failures with remarkable accuracy, enabling organizations to position themselves advantageously for future developments.

Ecosystem integration involves building AI agent networks that communicate and collaborate across departments, creating unprecedented operational intelligence. These interconnected systems share insights, coordinate responses, and optimize performance across the entire enterprise ecosystem. For example, an AI agent monitoring customer sentiment might automatically communicate with supply chain agents to adjust production schedules based on predicted demand changes, while simultaneously informing financial agents to update revenue forecasts and marketing agents to adjust campaign strategies.

Scalability considerations become increasingly important as organizations prepare for exponential AI agent deployment growth. Infrastructure must support not just current AI agent requirements, but anticipated future expansion. This includes planning for increased computational demands, expanded data storage needs, and enhanced network connectivity requirements. Organizations must also develop governance frameworks that can manage hundreds or thousands of AI agents operating simultaneously across different business functions.

Compliance and ethics considerations ensure responsible AI agent deployment in enterprise environments. Organizations must establish clear guidelines for AI agent decision-making authority, implement robust audit trails for agent actions, and maintain human oversight capabilities for critical business processes. Ethical AI deployment requires transparency in agent decision-making processes, fairness in automated outcomes, and accountability for agent actions. As AI agents become more autonomous and capable, these considerations become increasingly important for maintaining stakeholder trust and regulatory compliance.

The future of enterprise operations lies in the seamless integration of human intelligence and AI agent capabilities. Organizations that successfully navigate this transformation will gain significant competitive advantages through improved efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and accelerated innovation. The key to success lies in thoughtful implementation, continuous learning, and maintaining focus on creating value for customers, employees, and stakeholders through intelligent automation.

A rotated element can be also matched, but <strong id="""">only if</strong> everything else except the rotation are staying the same as it is displayed on the screen. If you can assure that your custom image is exactly the same as it is displayed on the screen + if you know the degree of the rotation, then you could consider using the <strong id="""">rotationDegreePerStep</strong> parameter. And because askui will try to rotate the custom element for the whole revolution, a divisor of the rotated degree could be also used, e.g in the illustrated case, we can use not only 90 but also 45, 30, 15, etc. But since smaller degrees will require more iteration steps, it will increase the runtime by a notable amount.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The simplest way</strong> to accomplish it might be <strong id="""">to directly capture and crop the desired image from your screen.</strong> In Windows and macOS, you can use the built-in screen capture tool:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Windows:</strong> Press <em id="""">windows</em> + <em id="""">shift</em> + <em id="""">s</em> (Windows 10 or higher)</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">macOS:</strong> Press <em id="""">cmd</em> + <em id="""">shift</em> + <em id="""">4</em></li></ul><p id="""">In both cases, you will be asked to select a certain portion of the screen. On Windows, the captured image will be stored in the clipboard, so you will need to save it to an image file. The image will be saved on the <em id="""">~/Desktop</em> by default on macOS.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">2) The Time of the Execution will Increase by a Notable Amount</strong></p><p id="""">To examine whether the custom image matches the given screen, askui iterates through the whole pixels of the screen and the custom image. So it is likely to increase the runtime by a notable amount. Therefore, if the task could be accomplished with other filters such as <em id="""">button()</em> or <em id="""">text()</em>, then it's maybe better to avoid using the <em id="""">customElement()</em></p><h2 id="""">Capture the Custom Element</h2><p id="""">In this demonstration, we will search for a certain area in <strong id="""">Google Street View</strong>.

These intelligent agents represent a paradigm shift from traditional AI models, offering a more sophisticated and versatile approach to problem-solving. This blog post will explore the technical intricacies of LLM agents, illuminating how they function and why they are poised to revolutionize the AI landscape.</p><p id="""">Traditional AI models, while capable of impressive feats, are inherently limited by the scope of their training data. They struggle to adapt to new tasks or access information beyond what they were initially trained on. LLM agents, on the other hand, are designed to overcome these limitations by seamlessly integrating the power of large language models (LLMs) with a diverse array of external tools and resources.</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><div class=""footer-cta_container"">

</div></div><p id=""""><strong id="""">The Power of Reasoning</strong></p><p id="""">At the core of an LLM agent's capabilities lies its enhanced reasoning ability. Unlike simpler models that might impulsively jump to the first solution that comes to mind, LLM agents employ a more deliberate and strategic ""think slow"" approach. They break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps, meticulously planning a course of action and carefully evaluating different approaches before proceeding. This sophisticated problem-solving process enables them to tackle intricate tasks that would prove challenging for traditional AI models.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beyond Reasoning: Taking Action with Tools</strong></p><p id="""">LLM agents don't just passively contemplate; they actively engage with the world around them by leveraging a diverse toolkit. These tools can range from simple utilities like search engines and calculators to more specialized programs like image recognition models and code execution environments. The LLM agent intelligently assesses the task at hand and strategically selects the most appropriate tools to achieve the desired outcome. Imagine an LLM agent tasked with planning a trip to Florida. It could access a weather API to check the forecast, consult a health website for sunscreen recommendations, and use a calculator to determine the optimal number of sunscreen bottles needed.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Learning and Adapting with Memory</strong></p><p id="""">Memory plays a crucial role in an LLM agent's ability to learn and adapt.&nbsp;LLM agents retain information from their past interactions, enabling them to build upon previous experiences and refine their approach over time. This stored memory might include past conversations with users, previously generated solutions, or even intermediate steps taken during problem-solving. By accessing and leveraging this wealth of information, LLM agents can provide more personalized, efficient, and contextually relevant responses.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The ReACT Framework: A Blueprint for Agentic Action</strong></p><p id="""">The ReACT framework, which stands for ""Reason and Act,"" provides a popular blueprint for configuring and orchestrating the actions of LLM agents. This framework emphasizes the agent's ability to carefully think through a problem step-by-step (reason) and interact with external tools to execute actions (act). When presented with a user query, a ReACT agent is prompted to plan its approach methodically rather than rushing to an immediate answer. It then iteratively selects and utilizes tools, carefully observes the results of its actions, and dynamically adjusts its plan as needed until a satisfactory solution is reached.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Unlocking New Possibilities</strong></p><p id="""">LLM agents hold the potential to unlock new possibilities in various fields. Their ability to automate complex tasks, enhance problem-solving capabilities, and deliver personalized experiences makes them a valuable asset across a range of applications. As these agents continue to evolve, we can anticipate even more groundbreaking applications that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.</p>","The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, and one of the most groundbreaking advancements is the emergence of LLM agents.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6720c65f1836191927499c3e_Designer%20(35).jpeg,"The image depicts a futuristic robot with glowing blue eyes and intricate circuitry designs, standing against a vibrant, neon-lit cityscape.

So Johannes, what is artificial intelligence?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> That's a really good question, especially since it's a name that's being thrown around quite a lot these days, right? Every company is doing stuff with AI now.</p><p id="""">In general, the concept of an artificial being that can think or do stuff similar to a human being, for example, is something that's been around actually since a long, since quite a long time.<br>There's history, the documented history of like, I think the Babylonians also already talking about this, though don't quote me on this. I'm not an expert on that.</p><p id="""">And yeah, so the idea that we that there could be some kind of machine-like being that is not a human, but similarly intelligent or even more intelligent, whatever that might mean, that's something that's been around for ages. And in the 1960s, I think that's when there was the last AI explosion, so to say, before there was kind of an AI winter, I think it's called, where people said, hey, now we have computers, right? We have machines, we can do stuff, we can train them or program them to do everything we humans can do, for example, also using computer vision.<br>And then we quite quickly realized that that is not necessarily the case.</p><p id="""">So that's, I think, where this modern concept of what artificial intelligence might be was coined the way we talk about it today. But more importantly, I think is also the question, what do we understand, right with this? But yeah, I don't want to grab a hat, so to say.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> It's quite philosophical when we talk about intelligence, so we can't define it for ourselves as humans. So how do we define it for machines?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, that's true.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, I think we leave the philosophical side aside. So we are from the technical side. So you talked about machines and we always talk about artificial intelligence.</p><p id="""">I personally dislike this term, if I'm being honest, because it implies some intelligence. For me, it's more like machine learning and there's also deep learning and then there's artificial intelligence. And I think a lot of people throw these terms around. I think there's a difference between that, between machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Maybe you can lay out what you see as a difference there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, I'll try to do that.</p><p id="""">So in general, the name I like most for what we are doing, for example, at askui is machine learning, right? I have a machine, I have a program and I have some task I wanted to solve where I cannot specifically define how to solve this task ahead of time. So while I'm writing my program, so to say, I don't know the exact way this program will work in the end.</p><p id="""">So I find algorithms that somehow figure out what the optimal programming of this machine is and that's called learning because it's an iterative process. I have examples usually, which I can show the machine to say, hey, look, given this input, this should be the output. And then using algorithms of various sorts, I can then teach this program how to behave. So that's machine learning.</p><p id="""">And there are very many ways to do that. And one of the more common ones nowadays is also called deep learning, right?<br>Where we have something called neural networks, which is basically fancy matrix multiplication many, many times and a way to teach these neural networks called backpropagation.</p><p id="""">So deep learning is a subset of all the techniques that you can call machine learning. And deep learning is also often associated with the name artificial intelligence.</p><p id="""">And the thing about this name artificial intelligence is it's not well defined, right? And the way I observe usually is that the moment we do something or we find a program that somehow seems like it could, for example, pass the Turing test, if you loosely interpret it, that's something we might call artificial intelligence.</p><p id="""">But to be honest, if you look at products that say, hey, we have artificial intelligence in it, it's usually just fancy algorithms and not real intelligence. And I'm saying that without even knowing what real intelligence is, right? So that's the main criticism of this name, I think. So it's more of a marketing term in my eyes and less of a specific specification, so to say, of what we're talking about.</p><p id="""">Actually, I have to quickly quote also where my thoughts are coming from. I just recently heard a podcast with Timnit Gebru, which people might know, who people might know, because she worked at Google in the ethics department and was fired for speaking out about racial topics concerning AI. And she's also now famous for a paper called Stochastic Parrots, where she's also discussing with a few colleagues about what language models are and what they are not.</p><p id="""">Because those are usually or nowadays called something like the spark of AI, I think is the name that's been thrown around, or the spark of artificial general intelligence, which is questionable, to put it in friendly terms. So if you want to learn about what artificial intelligence is and what not, I would recommend you check out her work too.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> We will link it in the show notes, of course. I know this paper, but I did not read it.</p><p id="""">But to iterate on the Turing test, for those not familiar with the Turing test, it's basically a test that was defined, okay, if a program can converse with a human and a human thinks that's another human, then the machine is intelligent enough to pass the test. And I think it already happened that a machine passed the Turing test.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Actually there's this famous example of the ELISA program, I think it's called, which was a super, super basic program that would ask you a question and then take your answer and just rephrase it in very simple rules as another follow-up question. And people would talk to this program on and on like that.</p><p id="""">I think it was even used, but again, don't quote me on this, in, I think, therapy for lonely people, because they could talk about their fears and their thoughts with somebody who would respond and would keep the conversation going without any form of intelligence lying underneath it.</p><p id="""">So I think that's really interesting. And I think it's really, really similar to what we're seeing with the famous chatGPT similar models, only that they are just way more fancy at how to generate new textural output.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, that's also my experience. Let's get to the last question.</p><p id="""">And somebody famous, I won't name here, talked about, yeah, chatGPT is so far ahead. It already seems like sentient AI. What brings us to the term when I studied it was like artificial general intelligence, or if you take the acronym, it's AGI.<br>What is AGI?</p><p id="""">Again, I have to quote Timnit Gebru on this. And AGI is a completely unspecified term. So I couldn't tell you, right? That's the point.</p><p id="""">The way I would interpret it, or I think the way it's generally interpreted is a system that can solve any task like a human would or better, like better than a human would, you know, whatever inputs we would, for example, expect ourselves like a command or some image or I don't know, a thought, whatever.</p><p id="""">But again, it's a very unspecified term and just says, hey, something that can do anything like a godlike creature.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Also when I studied was like, okay, this AGI could spawn sub-intelligences, intelligences,<br>that's the right term here so that it would multiply itself and those would learn together.<br>And then you have an exponential graph for knowledge and that they would surpass humanity, basically.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> I mean, of course, this is probably a possibility. But the thing is, I couldn't tell you and it sounds like science fiction to me at this point, right?</p><p id="""">The scientific process and again, I'm quoting this podcast from Adam Conover and with Timnit Gebru and another colleague of hers. They say that research is a process of exploration without necessarily knowing where we'll end up. The scientific process is I have a hypothesis and now I test it and see where it takes me. And this notion of we are getting to a point where this artificial intelligence will spawn other intelligences and so on to at some point surpass us. That basically is just an extrapolation of where we are right now from where we've been a few years ago.</p><p id="""">So that's a very linear way of thinking, which humans are famously good at. Everything we extrapolate we do linearly look at what people talked about Corona and then linear extrapolation didn't work anymore because Covid was an infectious exponential process.</p><p id="""">So I would be very careful about these kinds of predictions and definitions of what AGI is because I don't know where we will be in five years, ten years from now. Definitely the way there will be very, very interesting and we'll potentially find very amazing discoveries on the way. But I don't know if we'll find a system that will replicate and start the singularity. Let's find out.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Perfect last words for the first episode.</p><p id="""">We didn't talk about computer vision, but in the next episode we will dive into computer vision.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Looking forward to it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So see you until next time.</p><h2 id="""">Podcast Homepage</h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><div class=""cookieconsent-optout-marketing"">

This time we're talking about computer vision and again I have Johannes Haux with me.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Hey there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> And when we're talking about computer vision we also need an origin story, right? So what is computer vision and where does it come from Johannes?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> So good question. Computer vision as the name implies is the research field or the the process of giving computers eyes, giving computers vision. In computer vision we try to answer the question how can I give computers the ability to understand concepts that are present in images. So for example finding a person or describing the content of an image, these kinds of things.</p><p id="""">And interestingly in the 60s, I think 1966 around that time, people thought okay now let's just solve this problem. We have computers now, now let's teach them how to see and started a summer school with the goal to solve computer vision in the next few weeks. Like seriously that was the idea. And they quickly figured out that this is not possible, right? It's a little more complicated than that. And yeah that's why we're still doing computer vision and that's why we need neural networks to do certain computer vision tasks for us because some things are a little more easier to solve in computer vision but others are really complex and not necessarily intuitive for us as humans to implement.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So when they started out in 1966, how did they start out? What are the classical approaches from that time and until now?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Okay so this notion of: Explain to me what you're seeing. That was there right from the start. Now the question is what am I seeing, right? So for us as humans that's obviously an intuitive thing to answer, I'm seeing the world around me in color and partly also in 3D. But for a machine the usual input that I would give it to show it something is pixels in the vision context. Like a series of numbers that are loosely correlated or strongly correlated in a two-dimensional sense.</p><p id="""">Now how do I get information out of this, right? If I just take the pure image it's really just a bunch of numbers. Now I need to figure out how I can put those numbers into context and one of the earliest and also most successful ways of doing that is by applying filters or using kernel methods to simply say okay I have for example a small patch that I say: this looks like an edge for example a border of something. And then I take this small sample and I slide it over the given image and ask at each stop I make while sliding it over the image does this section of the image look like this small patch I have here and then I get a yes or no or something in between and by doing this for the whole image I can then say okay these parts in the image they look similar to this little patch and then I can define a number of patches that have different characteristics this looks like a blob this looks like an edge that's oriented 90 degrees to the other edge. </p><p id="""">These kinds of things and then generate a bunch of feature maps that then can be used to explain the content of the image for example if I know where edges are I can then say okay probably if I have connected edges in an image then the convex hull they build right will say that the inside of this hull is then one object or if I know how an eye looks I can then say okay in this image at those locations probably our eyes. And then I can use this for face tracking and use for example the distance of the eyes to say okay this is a person that's close to the camera etc so I can use these kinds of features to already answer not only basic but interesting questions about the content of images.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Let's remain at the eye example you're not looking straight at the camera all the time so we have some things like tilt in one left or right or up and down.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah so that's a really good point and that's also one of the limitations of these kinds of approaches. I need to cover all possible scenarios with the corresponding filters to be able to yeah say for example I'm looking from the side I'm looking above.</p><p id="""">These kinds of things though you have to say like if you restrict it to only cover cases where I'm looking at the camera which is you know 80% of the time for example in a video call then I'm totally fine with only a small number of filters that I can use to detect eyes at the moment those filters don't activate anymore I don't know where the eyes are and then I need for example tracking methods to make predictions or to patch together data once the signal is coming back again with data from or from signals from previously in the time so<br>yeah that's a problem.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> It also sounds like if you want to detect not only eyes but a few things in an image then you would need a lot of filters.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> That's true okay and there are also ways to do this for example what I didn't mention here right now is scale right if I get closer to the camera my eye is larger so in terms of pixel space the area my eye covers is larger. I need to compare it now to a differently sized patch etc. and scaling patches is fairly easy, right?</p><p id="""">I can do this so I can cover multiple scales like this. If I want to detect edges of various orientations I can just you know generate parametrically a number of filters for certain angles and so on and get more fine-grained so the question though is always what kind of task do I want to solve and what filters do I need for this task right and that's the interesting question and that's why for example still today face tracking is something that can be done very efficiently because I know very well how to do this with classical approaches and those are then of course highly optimized so you can do this in real time at literally no cost.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> It's basically what my camera is doing right now. Tracking my face to not lose its focus and it's blazingly fast yeah. Okay you have filters but basically do you have weights there? I know the concept of weights so you're not using every filter in the same weight or weight the same is that a concept here?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> I mean yeah that's basically a post-processing step I would guess. What you're referring to is now that I have information about the image, which information do I consider more valuable for the given task at hand but this concept of weights or this name is also used primarily in deep learning. Where I have learnable parameters and that I would say is again very similar but in that sense those weights are learned filters so depending on what you're getting at like the term weight might define something different.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So thanks for the explanation. That's already the closing words for episode two. We might want to get into other methods like deep learning as the next evolutionary technology because as we discussed here the classical approaches are very good at solving a single task but they might get complicated when you have to have a lot of filters.</p><p id="""">So stay tuned for the next episode!</p><h2 id="""">Podcast Homepage</h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><div class=""cookieconsent-optout-marketing"">

And this is where the classical approaches have their limits.</p><p id="""">This time we talk about deep learning, convolutional neural network or CNNs and how they could solve the problem.</p><p id="""">So Johannes, what are the state-of-the-art approaches? Because I think convolutional neural networks are the state of the art. Am I right?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> It really depends on who you ask, I guess. But I think at the time of recording CNNs convolutional neural networks still are the state-of-the-art for certain tasks.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So how do they tackle the problem that comes with the limits of classical approaches?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, very good question. So maybe let's define the problem a little more specifically. What we talked about in the last episode is that classical computer vision approaches are filter-based or kernel approaches. They require you to define a set of filters that will produce features that we're interested in. So this process of figuring out how I do extract stuff or information from the image. That's not only tedious, but also really biased and limited by what I can come up with. And sometimes I don't know what kind of features are the most interesting for the task I want to solve.</p><p id="""">And that's where a machine learning system comes in really handy because I can then ask the question: System, what filters do you need to answer the following question?</p><p id="""">Maybe to put this into historical context, the most prominent time this was done was, I cannot tell you exactly the year, but was done by Jan LeCun. He's currently at Facebook, the principal researcher there, when he wanted to extract the handwritten digits from checks. So if you want to transfer money.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So you use paper checks.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> You use paper checks. You have to write down the numbers. You have to extract this information that's usually done by a person, has to put it into an Excel sheet. That's quite tedious and sometimes error-prone.</p><p id="""">So how can we automate this process using images, photographs of those paper checks? And he solved this problem using confnets, really simple ones, only a few layers where then the features are generated by learned filters or by learned weights. You could also call them.</p><p id="""">Yeah, then decide, for example, which number you're seeing currently in the image. So that was the first CNN approach that became really, really popular and that sparked also the interest in convolutional neural networks.</p><p id="""">And then we quickly saw ever larger models that were able to not only do classification tasks at some point, but also more complex tasks like visual question answering. And some point then also generative tasks where I take an image and change the style of the image so that it looks like an artwork, etc, etc. So that's what you can do with convolutional neural networks and learned filters.</p><p id="""">In the end, we solved the problem of asking the question, what kind of filters I need to extract the relevant information by only giving a task and not caring about the exact filters we're using anymore, which is quite handy because that's a lot of work.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So let me sum it up. So you ask the question, I need the digits basically, and then you say to the network, solve this question, please.</p><p id="""">And is this some kind of layer? So you'd have a filter and then you get a feature map and the feature map is an input to another map. I remember deep learning from Google. They did it like this.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, that's where the term deep comes from in this scenario. So what you want to do is you want to aggregate information. So I have now an image or an array of pixels. I turn those into a number of feature maps using my learned filters. But that information itself is not really helpful. It's just a bunch of features.</p><p id="""">So I take those, this high dimensional collection of features, do the same thing again. I learn again, a bunch of filters that then use this information and turn it into another set of feature maps. And because of the nature of the process, each filter always collects information from a fixed set of pixels, for example, seven by seven or 11 by 11 or even smaller, and then aggregate the information in that area into a single value.<br>So over time with each layer, I aggregate more and more information into single values. And at some point I can then say, okay, now the number of features, I scale that down in my final layers, only for a certain set of features.</p><p id="""">And then finally, I take those features and put it into a prediction layer, a classification layer and say, now I want 10 values for digit classification. I want 10 values, value one. If that's high, then I know it's a zero. And if value 10 is high and all the other values are compared to that very low, then I know it's a nine, right? This way I turn feature layer after feature layer after feature layer into really condensed information that I can then use to do, for example, classification.</p><p id="""">So basically you do the same thing as in the classical approach. You learn filters and you stack them.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> And you can still reason about the learned filters, right?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Depends on what you mean with reason.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> So I can look at those and I can understand their function. Okay. Yeah, that's what I meant.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> And that's actually super, super interesting too, because a human would, for example, define a bunch of filters for edges, for blobs, for these kinds of things. And the neural network does the same, just a little more unconstrained, so to say. So we don't have the zero degree edge and the 90 degree edge, but we have a two degree and 92 degree edge, for example.</p><p id="""">And the combination of those two can then probably tell me any number of edges. So that's really interesting to see what the network comes up with. So you mentioned in your explanation before that you can also use the neural network not to just say, okay, this is a number or this is the number on the paper check, but you can also use this to generate things.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Why would I want to generate things in the first place?</p><p id="""">First of all, because it's cool. I mean, look at stable diffusion and all the other works. And maybe for just the sake of argument, leave out all the questions about ownership of art and so on.</p><p id="""">But if you just enable a person to generate a set of pixels that look funny, just given a prompt, that I think in itself is a really cool thing to do. So that's why you would, for example, want to generate things. But there are more reasons to do that. So for example, you would like to generate images when you don't have labeled data. Sounds probably a little bit strange.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Maybe you have to explain what a label is first.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Okay, yeah, sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. So a label would be, for example, in the scenario where I want to detect digits or classify digits would be that given this image, the label for it is the digit that's contained in it.</p><p id="""">So if I have an image of A2, the label would be A2. Now, what would happen if I have like a million images or so many images that it would be really hard to label them all? How would I still be able to gather information out of that?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, so basically you're talking about manual tagging.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Exactly. If I don't want to do this, is there still a way I can extract information from this image by applying some kind of algorithm?</p><p id="""">And one way to do this is to say, to build a network that needs to condense the information that's in the image into, for example, a low-dimensional vector. So in a dimensionality that's way lower than the inherent dimensionality of the space we're coming from. So image space and all the possible combinations of pixels that I could come up with, condense this information into something low dimensional and then take this information again to produce an image that must look exactly the same as the image I put in. And then I can compare the generated image with the given image and calculate a loss, which I can then use to train this system to come up with low-dimensional representations of the images I feed it.</p><p id="""">And then, for example, use this for retrieval tasks. And I can encode all the million images I have and group them by similarity in their vectors. And then I can find structures in my data, which is super interesting. And I can say, okay, this group of images, those are all digits with only one in it. And those are sevens. And some of the sevens are so poorly written that they are somewhere in between the two. And some of the ones are so squiggly that they are interpreted as a seven. And I cannot really decide. And that's how you can do really interesting stuff and use higher dimensional data in low-dimensional space and look at it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> That's cool. So basically, the generative AI stuff is a byproduct of the verification process.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> I would say it maybe started out that way, but it's definitely not a byproduct anymore. But then they were married there and then they used it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Cool.</p><p id="""">So that's already it for the convolutional neural networks. Thanks, Johannes.</p><p id="""">And we will talk in the next episode about deep learning architectures because that<br>was a very high-level explanation of what deep learning is.<br>But there are several architectures there that are specific for a specific domain task.</p><h2 id="""">Podcast Homepage</h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><div class=""cookieconsent-optout-marketing"">

Johannes got nearly ahead of himself.</p><p id="""">Let's talk about vision transformer architectures because they sound really futuristic.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't probably call it futuristic.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> I think it's just a fancy name.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Proven to be, yeah, the name you're getting at the name. Yeah, true. I mean, transformers, of course, it's good that they didn't call them. What are the other ones called?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Not the Autobots, but the Perceptrons.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Perceptrons, yeah.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> That's another architecture.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Oh, man. Oh, man. Now it's on the internet. We don't know too much about the transformer franchise.</p><p id="""">No, but what we do know about is the transformer architectures, right? So in the last episode, we talked about how convolutional networks aggregate information and that way put information into context. Transformers on the other hand, do this a little differently, right?</p><p id="""">They treat or they, let's put it differently. Transformers expect as inputs a sequence of any sort, right? So the origin of transformer architectures is from language modeling, especially from translation tasks.<br>So I have a sequence of words and I want to turn the sequence into a different sequence of words, French to English or whatever you want to do. So you need the context basically, because language is always contextual, that the meaning is all in the context.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Exactly.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Language is also really ambiguous. So word can mean various things depending on the context it's spoken in. And sometimes even the context of the other words is not enough. Sometimes if I say it to my mother, it's something different if I say it to a friend, but that's a whole different topic.</p><p id="""">But transformers put this sequence into context by using a process called attention or depending on which part of the transformer we're talking about, it's also sometimes called self-attention, which allows, as you say, to put each word into context with all the other words in a learned process. And this way I can be very good at producing sequences in turn that, for example, work well as a translation into a different language.</p><p id="""">Now why is that also interesting for computer vision? An image itself is not a sequence. And that's true, but I can take the inputs I give to a transformer and I can append more information to it. I can take each sequence element, I can say this comes from the top left corner, this comes from the top right corner, bottom left, bottom right. So you slice the image.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> We slice the image. So you get basically words.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Exactly. I take the image, turn it into words, into small patches, and I supply the information where this patch is coming from. And then the putting-into-context process can respect this information and then can decide if this is relevant information for the question.</p><p id="""">I'm asking of the task I'm trying to solve or maybe even discard it, which is also definitely possible depending on the task. And that's really the fact that this works is really interesting and was very surprising to me, at least because from an intuitive point of view, taking the image and treating it as a set of pixels from which I aggregate information into some abstract low dimensional representation is far more intuitive for me than to treat the image as a bunch of patches that I put into context with each other.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, makes sense.</p><p id="""">So that's how we humans would do it, like conversion neural networks, just okay, there's something and then okay, there's a cow, for example, or there's a human.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, to be honest, I really cannot comment on this because I'm not a neurologist. I don't really know.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, okay. I obviously also don't know. But that's how I perceive it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I would probably perceive it quite similarly.</p><p id="""">I think the interesting point is that we usually combine the two approaches, right? That we have this kind of pixel-based information aggregation and then putting the aggregated information into context with other aggregated information. That's what we were getting at the beginning of our conversation that, for example, these patches are turned into vectors using convolutional neural networks. Or I could even go so far as to take a convolutional neural network, apply to the entire image for a few layers. Then I get a lower dimensional image of vectors and then treat those vectors as input to a transformer network and then put this information into context to, for example, solve a classification problem or a segmentation problem or whatever problem we want to solve.</p><p id="""">But that's where the strength of the combination of the two approaches is. I can aggregate information and I can put it into context more reasonably. And to extend this a little bit more into the philosophical, that's also where I see the parallels to how we work as brain and eye interface, right?</p><p id="""">The eye in this case would be this sensor that takes this bunch of photons and colors and whatever and turns it into a nerve signal. And then the brain takes the signals that come in over time and puts them into context or takes the signals that come from various receptors on the eye and puts them into context. So that's kind of on a high level, probably wrong interpretation of how our brain works. But yeah, that's... Some biologists might correct us.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> If you can write us emails, I think they're probably like, please be gentle. But that's my intuitive understanding of why this works.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Yeah, that's intuitive understanding. And as far as my biological studies, I would say that's maybe correct.</p><p id="""">Yeah, you mentioned something which is maybe hard to understand.</p><p id="""">The attention or self-attention function. What is attention actually?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> Yeah, that's a really good question. Also, like the core of what makes transformers work, right? I would not try to explain how it's done in the transformer architecture, but give a more simple example, I think.</p><p id="""">So for example, if you want to attend to a sequence or a number of values, you would do this through simple matrix multiplication, where the matrix then is the set of attention weights. It's a learned set of weights that says, okay, if my input looks like this, the important value is this. So if I have a sequence of 10 examples or 10 values, the attention mechanism would then decide which of those 10 values is the most important at this point in time or in this given context or whatever.</p><p id="""">So the attention mechanism is basically a filter that gives you the most relevant information right now. And in the transformer, this then combined with a little more complex mathematics but in the end, it's still the same.</p><p id="""">I can ask the question over the sequence of given inputs, how do I want to attend to those values which are important to put into context with each other? And that's where self-attention comes in. I can then say, given this set of inputs, if I only have this context, which of those inputs is the most relevant? And the more general formulation of attention is given two sequences, which values would I want to put into context with each other? So that's a very rough explanation of what attention is.</p><p id="""">But the gist of it is you have a sequence, you want to find out which value is the most important, and that's what the attention mechanism solves for you. And it also takes into account the context of everything. Exactly. Yeah.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> Okay, so we do this for context because that's my next question.</p><p id="""">So now we have CNNs. They work well, as you described, and now we're doing vision transformer architectures because they work well in language domains. They also work well in computer vision domains.</p><p id="""">But why would we actually do the vision transformer architectures when CNNs just work fine?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> I think the why is because it works, right? It was an interesting thing to look at, and that's why the scientific community did take a look at it and figured out, hey, this actually works quite well, and for certain scenarios it works even better than CNNs.</p><p id="""">I don't really know a better reasoning right now, right? It's a scientific process, and you can interpret or, yeah, find reasons why you would do this that are maybe, yeah, because our brain is structured this way and that, like we did.</p><p id="""">But the real reason is because we do it because it works.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD:</strong> What a wonderful last words from you, Johannes,<br>on the closing episode number five, and also this season.</p><p id="""">Thanks for all the explanations, Johannes, and I hope we see you next season.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH:</strong> I would hope so, too. It was really fun. Thanks, Johannes.</p><h2 id="""">Podcast Homepage</h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><div class=""cookieconsent-optout-marketing"">

Yeah, but of course, you know, you can use satellites to detect dogs or cats, so there might be applications there that I'm not aware of.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Okay, what can we do with satellite data, for example?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Well, you can do a lot.As we talked about last episode, computer vision applications are usually, like most applications, trying to make our lives easier to solve our tasks that involve looking at this data.There are a few prominent examples, I guess.For example, weather forecasts, right?That's where we work with geospatial data.I know where the clouds are.I know where there's high air pressure, low pressure fields, where's precipitation, where's the air moist.This kind of stuff. And I can use this data to build models.Usually you don't do this as a computer vision task, but I've seen approaches where you tryto take the two-dimensional projection of this data to make short-term forecasts.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Like a few hours for the rain that comes down.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Yeah, or let it be like 15 minutes. That can also be of importance, right?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: These are actually pretty accurate. I always use this when I go for a walk.It just rains outside.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Oh, you do?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Yeah, it works.</p><p id="""">JH: So I don't know if there are already real-world applications where this is being done, butI would guess that's a very sensible thing.Because usually what's also a consideration there is compute.So how much energy do I have to spend to come up with a prediction that is accurate enough that I can show it to people, right?And those huge weather models, they are quite expensive, but they are the best thing we can do.Like a true simulation to make forecasts.But if I just want to interpolate between two time steps, for example, I don't need the entire world being modeled. Maybe don't even need the, like only Germany, for example, but I only need this for a very small location.And there it would make sense to have a model that can sample from some expected data distribution between two points.And that's where neural networks are actually pretty good at.But that's only one application.There are more applications you could think of.One that's also quite in the news these days is forest fire prediction.So I'm looking at forests and I try to figure out like, is there a high risk of a fire breaking out here so that I can do, for example, resource allocation.Where do I position my firefighters, et cetera.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Another approach or another task we can solve with computer vision for geospatial data is if there are natural disasters, for example, and I need to get relief in the area of the catastrophe, like how do I get there?And what's the most efficient way to get the needed goods to those critical areas and soon.Like these kinds of tasks you can solve.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: And then there's of course always the military that's also very interested in these kinds of things.And they always or usually try to figure out the questions of intelligence.Like where are the bad guys at?Where do I need to drop my bombs?These kinds of things usually not or sometimes from satellites, I guess, but also oftentimes using drones.And then you have like an image of a desert and a bunch of rocks.But one of those rocks is a bad guy I want to take out.So again, computer vision can be used to help people.But of course, like many tools, it can also be used to do kind of ethical, questionable stuff like killing people.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: So this would be object detection tasks like for example, find missing person or find a person.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Yeah, find a missing person. Like actually, very, very nice application.The positive sense for finding people in an image would be if you have, for example, a ocean and it's really, really hard to distinguish waves, for example, like the white crowns of a wave from parts of a plane, also white usually.Those are large usually.And then think of finding a person in an ocean.So there again, having computer assist a tool that can scan large amounts of data is really, really helpful.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Could we also use to track change over time?Like for example, the ice melting, the glaciers.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Yeah, that's being done.So the question there would be what's the questions I want to ask about this change.The documentation I would say is there for many areas of the world.And now where you could use deep learning, especially would be to make predictions about how those changes might continue.Or you could again, try to figure out like what were causes for accelerations and change and correlate with other kinds of data like temperature, CO2 level in the atmosphere and so on.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: That sounds quite interesting.Recurrent moment.There's also another application.I don't know if it's falling into geospatial analysis, to be honest.There's this object reconstruction and I think it was a few years ago was an ad fromMicrosoft for their eye platform where someone went into ruins and just scanned the image or scanned the surroundings and then they reconstructed the whole place virtually.Is that geospatial analysis?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: I mean, probably not, but it's a really interesting application.So for me, geospatial means somehow concerned with the earth, right?And spatial.So some kind of question about how are things related in a spatial sense or so, like looking at a map and reconstructing buildings, of course, means that I need some kind of building plan.So there is this spatial component to the task, but I would guess it's more like structure from motion thing where I, as I said, like walk around, take photographs from various angles so that I can figure out the spatial dimensions of the building and then I can make assumptions of what this building might have looked like.And then I can do an AR application which renders this to me so that I can look at it, which is, to be honest, that sounds really amazing.I would have loved to do that myself.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Cool.So when I think about insurers, for example, this is very famous.So in the city, you pay more for insurance, at least it's Germany, and also in the specific neighborhoods you pay more.Is that an application for geospatial analysis?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: I mean, of course.So property value estimation is being done automatically.I would say these days, I'm not totally familiar with the field, but it's definitely something where you use geospatial data.To be honest, the computer vision perspective on this topic I'm not really familiar with, but what you can do, for example, ask questions about property size or population density.And that usually correlates really strongly with property values and with then, of course, also the prices you have to pay for insurance.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Basically, a risk analysis.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Yeah.And if you then combine this with disaster prediction, where will be the next flash flood?Where will be the next mountain coming down?That of course factors into that probably as well.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: So you can say, okay, if that's built there, it's a high risk, it will get destroyed at some time.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Yeah, or if you move into this house, we won't insure you because there's like this huge mountain that's been shifting for the past 10 years.Okay, that's already happened.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Yeah, that's already a case.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: I've seen videos now from, I think, Switzerland and Austria, where there are entire villages that have to be evacuated because mountains are moving.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: That's really interesting.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: At least Austria, from what I know, they have really accurate 3D data of their mountains because they are interested in understanding how these mountains change over time to do these kinds of predictions.And they have really high resolution in terms of spatial, but also in terms of temporal resolution images and 3D scans of their mountain ranges.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JD</strong>: Well, that's kind of interesting.</p><p id="""">Okay, this marks already the end of episode two.So I think we did not exhaust all the geospatial analysis applications, but I think the oneJohannes knows about.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JH</strong>: Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p><p id="""">See you in the next episode where we will talk about generative AI and the real world applications.</p><h2

So, let's dive in and unlock the power of test automation for your software testing endeavors.</p><h2 id="""">Understanding Test Automation: Basics and Importance</h2><p id="""">Test automation is a technique that involves the use of specialized software tools to automate the execution of tests, compare the actual results to the expected results, and generate detailed test reports. It is a vital component of modern software development and testing processes, offering numerous benefits to organizations of all sizes.</p><h3 id="""">What is Test Automation?</h3><p id="""">Test automation involves the use of scripting or programming languages to create automated test scripts that simulate user interactions with the software under test. These scripts can perform various actions such as inputting data, interacting with user interfaces, and verifying expected outcomes. By automating these repetitive and time-consuming tasks, test automation helps teams save valuable time and resources while increasing the overall efficiency of the testing process.</p><h3 id="""">The Importance of Test Automation</h3><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Efficiency</strong>: Test automation significantly reduces the time and effort required to execute test cases. Automated tests can be run repeatedly and consistently, allowing for faster feedback on software quality. This efficiency enables teams to test more frequently, catch bugs earlier in the development cycle, and deliver high-quality software at a faster pace.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Accuracy</strong>: Manual testing is prone to human error, which can lead to inconsistent results and unreliable test outcomes. Test automation eliminates the risk of human error, ensuring accurate and reliable test results. Automated tests can precisely follow predefined steps and verify expected outcomes, providing confidence in the software's functionality.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Regression Testing</strong>: As software evolves and new features are added, regression testing becomes critical to ensure that existing functionality remains intact. Manual regression testing can be time-consuming and error-prone. Test automation allows for the creation of comprehensive regression test suites that can be executed effortlessly, guaranteeing that previously tested functionality continues to work as expected.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Increased Test Coverage</strong>: Test automation enables teams to achieve higher test coverage by executing a large number of tests across different platforms, configurations, and data sets. Automated tests can cover a wider range of scenarios and edge cases, helping to identify potential issues that might go unnoticed in manual testing.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cost Savings</strong>: While there is an initial investment in setting up and maintaining test automation infrastructure, the long-term cost savings can be substantial.

Neurosymbolic AI: Integrating Logic and Learning,neurosymbolic-ai-integrating-logic-and-learning,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,673b0482c2ec5c92083ff9bb,FALSE,FALSE,Mon Nov 18 2024 09:10:26 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 25 2024 08:58:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 25 2024 08:58:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">Symbolic AI, rooted in early AI research, aims to mimic human intelligence by creating systems that manipulate symbols based on logical rules. These symbols are used to represent objects, concepts, and relationships in the world, allowing the system to deductively reason as a human might when solving logic puzzles. An illustrative instance is a symbolic AI system understanding the sentence ""The ball is red,"" by deconstructing it into symbols like ""ball,"" ""red,"" and ""is"" to deduce that the ball possesses the attribute of redness.</p><h2 id="""">The Limitations of Symbolic AI</h2><p id="""">Despite its effectiveness in specific domains, symbolic AI struggles with real-world complexity due to its dependence on explicit rules and handcrafted knowledge, making it brittle and inflexible. Identifying a cat in an image exemplifies this limitation— a purely symbolic AI system might rely on rigid rules such as ""has fur,"" ""has four legs,"" ""has tail,"" which fall short in real-world scenarios where a cat may be partially obscured, viewed from different angles, or vary in lighting conditions.</p><h2 id="""">The Emergence of Neurosymbolic AI</h2><p id="""">Neurosymbolic AI aims to bridge these gaps by merging deep learning's strengths with the reasoning abilities of symbolic AI. While deep learning excels at identifying patterns from vast data—key for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing—neurosymbolic AI combines this with the symbolic AI's logical reasoning. In the cat identification example, a neurosymbolic AI system can use a deep learning model trained on extensive image data to identify the cat regardless of variations in pose, lighting, or occlusion. This model serves as a perceptive engine, converting sensory data into symbolic forms that the symbolic AI component can manipulate.</p><h2 id="""">Benefits of Neurosymbolic AI</h2><p id="""">This integration allows neurosymbolic AI to move beyond traditional symbolic AI with several advantages:</p><p id="""">1. <strong>Learning from Data</strong>: Neurosymbolic systems can learn directly from data using deep learning, enabling them to adapt to new situations and manage real-world uncertainty and ambiguity.</p><p id="""">2. <strong>Common Sense Reasoning</strong>: By providing a framework for relationships between objects and concepts, symbolic AI equips neural networks with a common sense reasoning capability. This allows for complex inference, question answering, and problem-solving beyond pattern recognition.</p><p id="""">3. <strong>Explainable Decisions</strong>: The transparency of symbolic AI's explicit rules and logic aids neurosymbolic AI systems in explaining their decision-making processes, crucial for building trust and understanding in AI applications.</p><h2 id="""">Applications and Future Potential</h2><p id="""">Despite being a nascent field, neurosymbolic AI has demonstrated promise. Researchers have crafted systems capable of:</p><p id="""">- Tracking objects even when hidden, showing an understanding of object permanence.</p><p id="""">- Answering questions about images using combined neural networks, symbolic AI, and probabilistic reasoning.</p><p id="""">- Translating natural language into logical forms to reason over knowledge bases and answer complex questions.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">By integrating deep learning and symbolic reasoning, neurosymbolic AI is poised to advance intelligent agent AI, creating systems that learn, reason, and interact more like humans. Its potential to develop more sophisticated, adaptable, and explainable AI could revolutionize how intelligent systems benefit society, fostering increased trust and effectiveness.</p>",Neurosymbolic AI aims to bridge these gaps by merging deep learning's strengths with the reasoning abilities of symbolic AI.,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673b0327de85dfa7b6deb3af_Designer%20(64).webp,"A person is creating an intricate illustration of a futuristic brain using colored pencils on white paper.

The goal is to create <strong id="""">intelligent agent AI</strong> that can learn, reason, and solve problems more like humans do.</p><h2>Deep Learning</h2><p id="""">Deep learning, inspired by the structure of the human brain, has excelled in tasks like image recognition and language translation. Neural networks, the workhorse of deep learning, process vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. However, these systems struggle to explain their decisions, generalize to new situations, and lack the common sense reasoning that comes naturally to humans.</p><h2>Symbolic AI</h2><p id="""">Symbolic AI, on the other hand, focuses on representing knowledge through symbols and rules. This approach excels at logical reasoning and providing clear explanations. However, symbolic AI systems often require extensive hand-crafted knowledge and can struggle to handle the complexities and uncertainties of the real world.</p><h2 id="""">Neurosymbolic AI</h2><p id="""">Neurosymbolic AI seeks to <strong id="""">combine the strengths of both approaches</strong>. Neural networks can be used to extract symbolic representations from data, such as identifying objects in images and translating pixels into symbolic form. Symbolic AI algorithms, in turn, can provide neural networks with common sense reasoning and domain knowledge, allowing them to describe relationships between objects, make predictions, and answer complex questions.</p><p id="""">One promising avenue of research in neurosymbolic AI is to model AI systems after the way <strong id="""">babies learn</strong>. Infants develop an understanding of the world through active exploration and interaction, gradually building a ""common sense"" model of physics and causality. By incorporating insights from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, researchers hope to create AI systems that learn and reason more like children, requiring less data and exhibiting greater flexibility and adaptability.</p><h2 id="""">Early Experiments</h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Early experiments in neurosymbolic AI</strong> have yielded encouraging results. For instance, researchers have developed algorithms that can track objects even when they are hidden, demonstrating a rudimentary understanding of object permanence, a concept mastered by infants early in development. Other research focuses on bridging the gap between vision and language, allowing AI systems to answer questions about images by combining neural networks with symbolic AI and probabilistic reasoning.</p><h2>Natural language processing</h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Natural language processing</strong> is another key area where neurosymbolic AI holds promise. Researchers are developing techniques to translate natural language sentences into logical forms, enabling AI systems to leverage existing knowledge bases and perform more sophisticated reasoning tasks. This could lead to AI assistants that can understand and respond to complex requests, going beyond simple commands and engaging in more meaningful conversations.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p id="""">The development of neurosymbolic AI is still in its early stages, but researchers believe it holds the key to <strong id="""">unlocking the next generation of intelligent systems</strong>. By combining the strengths of deep learning and symbolic AI, neurosymbolic AI aims to create AI that is not only powerful but also explainable, adaptable, and capable of true common sense reasoning. These advances have the potential to revolutionize fields such as customer support, business intelligence, healthcare, and scientific discovery.</p>",Neurosymbolic AI is an emerging field that strives to bridge the gap between two powerful forms of artificial intelligence: deep learning and symbolic,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673b0327de85dfa7b6deb3af_Designer%20(64).webp,"A tablet displays a digital illustration of a human profile with a circuit-like brain.

Orchestrator Agents Enhancing AI Vision Agents,orchestrator-agents-enhancing-ai-vision-agents,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,67333477b65d7c5ab4992cad,FALSE,FALSE,Tue Nov 12 2024 10:56:55 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Nov 21 2024 07:11:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Nov 21 2024 07:11:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant headway in various domains, notably in the visual processing domain. The orchestrator agent offers a strategic enhancement in how these systems operate. Essentially, the orchestrator agent serves as a sophisticated managerial layer that coordinates various vision AI agents, enabling a seamless transition between user intent and technical execution in visual tasks. </p><h2 id="""">Central Role of the Orchestrator Agent</h2><p id="""">The orchestrator agent functions as a pivotal component within AI vision systems, acting not as a direct executor, but rather as a facilitator and manager. Its principal role is to interpret users' natural language queries and assign appropriate tasks to specialized AI vision agents. These tasks are then executed by these individual agents or other integrated tools, with the orchestrator agent synthesizing the outputs into a cohesive response.</p><p id="""">By doing so, the orchestrator agent operates as a central control unit, crucially deciding on the selection and combination of AI tools and how best to present results to users. It essentially transforms disparate AI vision functions into a sophisticated and intelligent system, offering a user-friendly interface and enhanced interaction.</p><h2 id="""">Enhancing Capabilities with an Orchestrator Agent</h2><p id="""">The implementation of an orchestrator agent in AI vision systems brings several notable enhancements:</p><h3 id="""">1. Enhanced Communication and Understanding</h3><p id="""">The orchestrator agent improves communication between the system and its users by interpreting complex user requests into actionable tasks. Unlike conventional AI systems that might struggle with nuanced inquiries, the orchestrator agent can handle more intricate interactions. For instance, when a user wants to ""track the player with the most movement,"" the orchestrator agent doesn't just execute blindly; it seeks clarification and explains its methodology. This results in a more transparent and intuitive user experience, bridging the gap between human language and machine execution effectively.</p><h3 id="""">2. Expanded Functionality and Task Complexity</h3><p id="""">The coordination of multiple AI vision agents by the orchestrator agent vastly expands the system's functional scope. It enables the handling of more complex, multi-step tasks through its ability to delegate responsibilities among various specialized agents. For example, managing a sports video analysis that requires detection, tracking, and performance metrics evaluation can be efficiently orchestrated. This layered approach allows systems to approach real-world tasks with a sequence of comprehensive visual operations that a lone agent would struggle to manage effectively.</p><h3 id="""">3. Improved Adaptability and Flexibility</h3><p id="""">Adaptability is critical in the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. The orchestrator agent's design allows it to integrate new tools and methodologies swiftly, ensuring that the system remains at the forefront of AI advancements. As new technologies or AI models emerge—like an improved object tracking system—the orchestrator agent can incorporate these advancements without disrupting the existing architecture. This adaptability not only enhances the system's current capabilities but also future-proofs it against technological obsolescence.</p><h3 id="""">4. Elevated User Experience</h3><p id="""">An orchestrator agent significantly improves the user experience by managing interactions, offering feedback, and presenting results in an easily digestible format. Rather than burdening users with raw data or technical jargon, the orchestrator agent can generate visual summaries or interactive dashboards tailored to specific user requirements. This focus on user-centric design allows individuals to concentrate on their objectives without becoming encumbered by the complexities of vision AI processing.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">The orchestrator agent orchestrates a finely-tuned interaction between multiple vision AI agents, enhancing the overall capabilities and offering an elevated user experience. By seamlessly integrating new technologies and executing complex tasks efficiently, the orchestrator agent ensures that vision AI systems remain current, adaptable, and user-friendly. As AI continues to evolve, the orchestrator agent holds the promise of making these systems increasingly sophisticated and accessible to broader audiences. Through enhanced communication, expanded functionalities, improved adaptability, and an elevated user experience, the orchestrator agent is transforming the way vision AI systems operate, offering sophisticated solutions for tackling real-world visual challenges.</p>","Essentially, the orchestrator agent serves as a sophisticated managerial layer that coordinates various vision AI agents.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6733343a940aef3fdd555999_Designer%20(55).webp,"The image portrays a man in a suit thoughtfully gazing at a large, high-tech digital eye and globe composite floating in the air.

But what happens when you're dealing with applications that render their UI on a canvas like many .NET desktop apps? Automating these is a whole different story.</p><p id="""">Unlike standard web or desktop elements that are easy to identify using the DOM or UI trees, canvas-based UIs are drawn pixel by pixel. This makes them incredibly flexible but also incredibly difficult to automate. In this post, we’ll break down why .NET canvas applications are so challenging to automate, what current tools offer, and how innovative solutions like AskUI are changing the game.</p><p id="""">👉 <a href=""https://www.askui.com/customers/from-manual-testing-to-automated-excellence-zucchettis-success-with-askui""><strong id="""">Discover how AskUI helped Zucchetti—and how it can help you</strong></a></p><p>‍</p><h3 id="""">Why Are .NET Canvas Applications Hard to Automate?</h3><p id="""">Canvas elements render visuals dynamically, often outside traditional UI hierarchies. That means no buttons, no checkboxes, no text fields for your test automation tools to hook into. Here are the core challenges:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">No DOM or UI Tree Access:</strong> Since canvas elements are just pixels on a screen, automation tools can’t locate elements by ID, class, or XPath.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Pixel Dependency:</strong> Interaction relies on screen coordinates, which can change based on resolution, scaling, and device setup.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inconsistent Rendering:</strong> Different systems might render the same canvas content slightly differently, leading to flaky tests.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Complex User Interactions:</strong> Dragging, drawing, zooming, and gestures are difficult to simulate reliably.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Dynamic &amp; Animated Content:</strong> Real-time updates make it hard to define fixed checkpoints or wait conditions.</li></ul><h3 id="""">The Limitations of Traditional Automation Tools</h3><p id="""">Standard test automation tools aren’t built for canvas. Selenium is great for web apps, but it can’t interact with canvas content directly. FlaUI supports .NET desktop apps better, but still struggles with canvas elements and often needs custom code. Winium is outdated and lacks support for modern UI needs. Appium is ideal for mobile testing, but not for desktop apps using canvas.</p><p id="""">Because of these gaps, some teams try visual testing tools like Percy or Resemble.js, which compare screenshots to highlight changes. However, these tools don’t interact with the UI itself they just show visual differences, which isn’t enough for thorough automation.</p><h3 id="""">Common Pitfalls in Canvas UI Automation</h3><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Flaky Tests</strong>: Hardcoded coordinates break easily with minor UI shifts.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Poor Debugging</strong>: Without UI references, it’s hard to pinpoint why a test failed.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Accessibility Testing Gaps</strong>: Traditional tools can’t verify if canvas UIs meet accessibility standards.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Performance Issues</strong>: High-resolution canvases or animations can slow down test execution.</li></ol><h3 id="""">Best Practices for .NET Canvas Automation</h3><p id="""">Despite these challenges, teams can still build reliable canvas automation by adopting smart practices:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Fix the Environment</strong>: Lock in screen resolution, DPI, and window size to reduce variability.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Use Visual Validation</strong>: Screenshot-based tools can detect layout and rendering changes.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Script Thoughtfully</strong>: Prefer logic via exposed APIs or in-app functions when available.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Add Smart Waits</strong>: Use polling, timeouts, and condition checks to handle dynamic content.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Monitor Closely</strong>: Integrate logging and visual reports to catch and fix issues fast.</li></ul><h3 id="""">The Better Way: AskUI + Computer Vision</h3><p id="""">Most automation tools weren’t built with canvas in mind but AskUI is different. It uses <strong id="""">AI and computer vision</strong> to analyze your app visually, just like a human would. That means AskUI doesn’t rely on DOM trees or UI selectors. Instead, it “sees” the canvas, interprets its content, and interacts with it intelligently.</p><p id="""">This is especially useful for:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Interactive UIs with custom gestures or drawings</li><li id="""">Real-time dashboards and animated charts</li><li id="""">Games and simulation tools</li><li id="""">Any .NET app that heavily uses canvas-based rendering</li></ul><p id="""">➡️ <a href=""https://www.askui.com/customers/from-manual-testing-to-automated-excellence-zucchettis-success-with-askui"" id=""""><strong id="""">See it in action with Zucchetti’s success story</strong></a></p><p id="""">Zucchetti, a global enterprise software provider, faced all the classic canvas automation headaches. By switching to AskUI, they moved from slow, manual testing to fast, scalable automation without sacrificing accuracy.</p><p id="""">Their story is a must-read for any QA or DevOps team tackling similar challenges.</p><h3 id="""">Final Thoughts</h3><p id="""">.NET canvas applications don’t have to be a test automation nightmare.

</html></div><h2 id="""">What Are Multi-Agent Systems in APA?</h2><p id="""">A multi-agent system is a framework where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to achieve a complex goal. This architecture is crucial for tackling enterprise-scale problems by deconstructing a workflow into manageable tasks, managed by what is now called <strong id="""">AgentOps</strong>.</p><p id="""">For example, in a content generation pipeline:</p><ol start=""1"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Research Agent</strong> scours the web for trending topics and data.</li><li><strong id="""">Writer Agent</strong> drafts an article based on the research.</li><li><strong id="""">Editor Agent</strong> fact-checks, refines the tone, and formats the output.</li><li><strong id="""">Publisher Agent</strong> pushes the content to a CMS and schedules it.</li></ol><p id="""">This collaborative approach requires robust inter-agent communication protocols and governance, which are central tenets of the emerging AgentOps discipline.</p><h2 id="""">How Do You Manage Agents in Production? The Rise of AgentOps</h2><p id="""">As organizations move from experimenting with single agents to deploying multi-agent systems, a new discipline has emerged: <strong id="""">AgentOps</strong>. AgentOps is the DevOps for AI agents, providing the framework for managing the lifecycle of non-deterministic, autonomous systems in production.</p><p id="""">Key components of AgentOps include:</p><ul id=""""><li><strong id="""">Deployment &amp; Orchestration:</strong> Managing the coordinated deployment of multiple agents.</li><li><strong id="""">Observability &amp; Monitoring:</strong> Tracking agent performance, decision-making processes, and token consumption.</li><li><strong id="""">Governance &amp; Security:</strong> Setting permissions, managing identities, and creating audit trails for agent actions.</li><li><strong id="""">Prompt Management:</strong> Version control and A/B testing for the prompts that define agent behavior.</li></ul><h2 id="""">What Are the 2025 Frontiers in Agentic AI?</h2><p id="""">The cutting edge of APA in 2025 has moved beyond simple task execution into truly autonomous operation. The two most significant frontiers are:</p><ol start=""1"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Self-Healing Workflows:</strong> Agents can now detect when a process breaks—due to a changed UI element, a deprecated API endpoint, or an unexpected error—and autonomously find a new solution. For example, if a website's ""Submit"" button changes its ID, a self-healing agent can analyze the DOM to find the new button and update its own process, requiring zero human intervention.</li><li><strong id="""">Dynamic Tool Discovery:</strong> Instead of being limited to a pre-defined set of tools (APIs), advanced agents can actively search for and learn to use new tools on the fly. When faced with a novel problem, an agent could find a relevant public API, read its documentation, and integrate it into its workflow to solve the task.</li></ol><h2 id="""">What Are the Evolved Security &amp; Ethical Risks of APA (2025)?</h2><p id="""">The increased autonomy of APA introduces more sophisticated risks that require an ""identity-first"" security posture. Agents are a new, complex attack surface within your organization.</p><p id="""">Key evolved risks include:</p><ul id=""""><li><strong id="""">Emergent Behavior Bugs:</strong> In complex multi-agent systems, the interaction between agents can lead to unforeseen and undesirable outcomes that are difficult to debug.</li><li><strong id="""">Sophisticated Data Exfiltration:</strong> A compromised agent with broad permissions could autonomously navigate internal systems to find and exfiltrate sensitive data.</li><li><strong id="""">Machine Identity Management:</strong> Each agent requires a secure, managed identity with the principle of least privilege. Unsecured agent identities are a primary threat vector.</li><li><strong id="""">Automation Bias:</strong> As agents become more capable, teams may over-trust their outputs, leading to a lack of critical human oversight in high-stakes decisions.</li></ul><h2 id="""">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2><h3 id="""">What is AgentOps and why is it essential for scaling automation?</h3><p id="""">AgentOps is the set of practices and tools for managing the complete lifecycle of AI agents in a production environment, similar to how DevOps manages traditional software. It is essential because autonomous agents are non-deterministic and require specialized methods for deployment, monitoring, governance, and security to be scaled reliably and safely across an enterprise.</p><h3 id="""">How will APA change software business models?</h3><p id="""">APA is accelerating the shift from traditional SaaS licensing (per seat, per month) to <strong id="""">outcome-based pricing</strong>. Instead of paying for access to the software, companies will increasingly pay for the results the agents deliver—such as cost per processed insurance claim, fee per qualified sales lead, or revenue share from automated e-commerce optimizations.</p><h3 id="""">Can APA integrate with existing enterprise systems and APIs?</h3><p id="""">Yes, robust integration is a core function of APA. Agents are equipped with ""tools"" that allow them to interact with any system that has an API, enabling them to orchestrate workflows across your entire tech stack, from modern SaaS platforms to legacy enterprise systems.</p><h3 id="""">What skills does my team need to transition from RPA to APA?</h3><p id="""">The transition requires a skill shift from process scripting to AI-centric roles. Key skills include prompt engineering, API integration management, AgentOps practices, data science for validation, and a strong understanding of system design for building secure and resilient multi-agent architectures.</p>","Agentic Process Automation (APA) uses adaptive AI agents for dynamic workflows, unlike rigid RPA.

The quest to elevate AI systems from mere pattern recognition to effective reasoning reflects the essence of cognitive abilities that characterize human intelligence. This exploration delves into the fundamental aspects of reasoning in AI, shedding light on its current limitations and innovations such as neurosymbolic AI, which aims to bridge the gap.</p><h2 id="""">Understanding Reasoning in AI</h2><p id="""">In humans, reasoning is the ability to logically analyze situations, draw inferences, and make informed decisions. It's a critical component of cognition that allows us to interact with the world, solve challenges, and navigate decision-making processes. For AI systems, replicating this ability is crucial to enhance their functionality and reliability in real-world applications.</p><h2 id="""">Challenges Faced by Traditional AI in Reasoning</h2><p id="""">Traditional AI methodologies have their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to reasoning. Symbolic AI systems, which are based on logic and predefined rules, offer a degree of reasoning but falter when faced with real-world complexity. Their rigidity makes them unsuitable for dealing with the fluid, uncertain nature of real-life scenarios. On the other hand, deep learning, a subset of AI that excels in pattern recognition, lacks the capability to reason beyond learned patterns. It struggles to provide explanations for its outputs and handle common sense reasoning tasks.</p><h2 id="""">The Neurosymbolic AI Approach</h2><p id="""">To overcome these challenges, neurosymbolic AI proposes a fusion between deep learning and symbolic logic. By integrating the data-driven learning strengths of neural networks with the logical structuring of symbolic AI, neurosymbolic AI aims to achieve a more adaptable and human-like reasoning ability. This combination strives to facilitate understanding and decision-making processes that are both robust and explainable.</p><h2 id="""">Types of Reasoning Targeted by Neurosymbolic AI</h2><p id="""">The potential of neurosymbolic AI unfolds through various reasoning capabilities it seeks to master:</p><ul><li>‍<strong>Common Sense Reasoning</strong>: This involves making logical inferences based on everyday knowledge and experiences, similar to how humans perceive the continuity of objects even when they are out of view.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Multi-hop Reasoning</strong>: This type of reasoning enables AI to connect and draw conclusions from multiple pieces of information or steps, akin to building a narrative or solving complex puzzles.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Quantitative, Geographic, and Temporal Reasoning</strong>: These specialized reasoning forms involve understanding and analyzing numerical data, spatial locations, and temporal sequences respectively, enhancing AI's capability to operate in diverse scenarios.</li></ul><h2 id="""">Logical Neural Networks (LNNs): A Step Forward</h2><p id="""">A noteworthy development in neurosymbolic AI is the advent of Logical Neural Networks (LNNs). LNNs are designed to incorporate reasoning into neural networks through real-valued logic, which represents uncertainty and the interaction strength among logical clauses. This innovation allows AI systems to perform nuanced and sophisticated reasoning, offering a significant leap from traditional neural networks.</p><h2 id="""">Reasoning and Explainability in AI</h2><p id="""">Reasoning enhances not only the capability of AI systems but also their transparency. Symbolic reasoning, which relies on explicit rules and logic, improves the explainability of AI. This transparency is vital for building trust and ensuring accountability, especially in critical applications where understanding the rationale behind AI decisions is paramount.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">Intelligent agent AI is increasingly driven by the need to possess reasoning abilities parallel to human intelligence. Innovations like neurosymbolic AI aim to imbue AI systems with more adaptable, human-like reasoning abilities, transcending the conventional limitations of traditional AI approaches. As these systems evolve, they promise to make AI applications more relatable, explainable, and ultimately more valuable in our daily lives.</p>",Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to evolve with advancements aimed at enhancing its reasoning capabilities.,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673b10669ad628aba5e79b06_Designer%20(68).webp,"A woman with long, dark hair gazes intently forward, her face partially transformed with intricate cybernetic details.

We will modify this a little bit to use the visual selectors from AskUI, which do not rely on the specific UI-technology but identify elements through their appearance with an AI vision model.</p><p id="""">Here are the steps we will implement:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Trigger the smoke test once per day</li><li id="""">Perform the smoke test with AskUI on a remote system</li><li id="""">Send an email if the smoke test was successful or not</li></ul><h2 id="""">1.

Prepare a Custom Code Action</h2><p id="""">AskUI does not have an action in Pipedream. So we will make use of the AskUI node package and run a custom code action. For this we a a _<em id="""">Code</em> action. In this action we will fill out the simple authentication from <a href=""https://authenticationtest.com/simpleFormAuth/"" id="""">https://authenticationtest.com/simpleFormAuth/</a>. If we see the success page we will send </p><p id="""">We have to do the following steps:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Add a property <strong id=""""><code id="""">uiControllerUrl</code></strong>, so we do not have to hardcode it into the code</li><li id="""">Store our credentials in <a href=""https://pipedream.com/settings/env-vars"" id="""">environment variables</a></li><li id="""">Import <strong id=""""><code id="""">UiControlClient</code></strong> from the AskUI node package</li><li id="""">Configure the AskUI <strong id=""""><code id="""">UiControlClient</code></strong> to use the credentials and the <strong id=""""><code id="""">uiControllerUrl</code></strong></li></ul><p id="""">The first thing we want to add to our custom code is the <strong id="""">uiControllerUrl</strong>. Click <strong id="""">Refresh fields</strong> so the <strong id="""">Configure</strong> tab shows up at the start of the action. Here is the relevant code snippet.</p><pre></pre><p id="""">Then head over to <a href=""https://pipedream.com/settings/env-vars"" id="""">environment variables</a> and add your <strong id="""">workspaceId</strong> and <strong id="""">accessToken</strong> there. You obtained those by following the <a href=""#prerequisites"" id="""">prerequisites instructions above</a>. You can now setup the connection to the AskUI Controller over the <strong id="""">UiControlClient</strong> like this. Notice how easy it is to use arbitrary node-packages in Pipedream? I only needed to import <strong id="""">UiControlClient</strong> and it just worked 🥳.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Note: The following code also contains the teardown.</em></p><pre></pre><h2 id="""">3. Write the AskUI Workflow</h2><p id="""">When you look at our example form, we want to fill out, you notice that we have to do the following things:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Write <strong id=""""><code id="""">simpleForm@authenticationtest.com</code></strong> into the textfield <strong id="""">E-Mail Address</strong></li><li id="""">Write <strong id=""""><code id="""">pa$$w0rd</code></strong> into the next textfield</li><li id="""">Click the button <strong id=""""><code id="""">Log In</code></strong></li><li id="""">Validate the success</li></ul><p id="""">The less inference we invoke the faster the AskUI workflow will execute. Everything that prompts AskUI to search for an element on the screen invokes inference. So let us try to invoke the inference only once by finding the first textfield for the E-Mail Address. Then we will use keypresses to navigate the form. This is the code to achieve this:</p><pre></pre><h2 id="""">Send an Email</h2><p id="""">Doing a smoke test without reporting about its success state would not help us. So we will just send us an email with the <strong id="""">Send Yourself an Email</strong> action. </p><p id="""">As subject we choose <strong id="""">Smoke Test State</strong> and for the text we reference our success variable we returned in our action above with <strong id=""""><code id="""">{{steps.code.$return_value.success}}</code></strong>.</p><h2 id="""">Gitpod As Remote Machine</h2><p id="""">If you do not have a remote machine ready-to-go you can use a service like Gitpod. We have a prepared <a href=""https://github.com/askui/askui-try-out"" id="""">Try-Out-Repository</a> which comes with AskUI already setup and a VNC to observe the AskUI workflow. Start the repository in Gitpod over the <strong id="""">Open in Gitpod</strong>-button and let it finish the predefined AskUI workflow.

Head to the <strong id="""">PORTS</strong> tab and make the port <strong id=""""><code id="""">6769</code></strong> public.

Test Automation Trends 2026: 3 Massive Shifts from Real-World Launch,test-automation-trends-2026,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,68e647a8855a08b8821d0361,FALSE,FALSE,Wed Oct 08 2025 11:14:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Oct 08 2025 13:27:14 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Oct 15 2025 11:27:06 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">Launching a new project is always a thrill yet what’s even more exciting is what happens next .</p><p id="""">When we showed <a href=""http://caesr.ai"" id="""">Caesr.ai</a>&nbsp; to the real-world, we were humbled to see over 500K test automation professionals join our platform in the early weeks. However, this number isn’t just a milestone, it is a massive real-time dataset that gives a unique snapshot into the future test automation.<br><br></p><p id="""">So, we are not here to talk about what kind of features our product have. We’re here to share with you the community that has shown us about the future of our industry. We analyzed the patterns, the choices and the behaviors of this incredible user base, and we found a few massive changes underway.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">In this news letter, we will dive into three key trends that we believe will define the new wave of automation. These key trends are a paradigm shift towards durable automation, generative AI revolutionizing test creation, and achieving real collaboration through automation.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Trend 1: The End of the Selector Era and the Massive Shift to Visual Recognition</strong></h2><p id="""">If there is one amazing phenomenon our launch data showed us, it is that teams are no longer looking for temporary solutions for brittle, the tests that are based on selector, but are instead demanding a basic paradigm change.</p><p id="""">The most embraced part of our platform wasn't a single feature, but the main approach of automating by visually understanding the UI like a human way. This shows that industry’s powerful drive to escape the essential limitations of selector based automation , which causes tests to break with the slightest change to the front-end code.</p><p id="""">Teams are no longer just seeking for a ‘better selector.’ They are actively adopting a new paradigm that is unbreakable by design and does not require selectors at all. This is not just a trend. It’s the beginning of a huge transformation.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Trend 2: Generative AI is Solving the Challenge in Test Creation, Not just Execution</strong></h2><p id="""">Until now, the challenges in automation have been centered on test execution and maintenance. However, the real challenge is now changing to the creation of test cases. Our data clearly shows how generative AI is solving this problem.</p><p id="""">Teams that used Caesr.ai's ability to automatically generate test , by visually analyzing real user session recording were able to expand their test coverage 40% faster on average in the first month. This shows developers or QA engineers can now use their time effectively on repetitive script writing and concentrate on more complex, creative problem solving. Speeding up test creation is becoming a key driver for accelerating the entire development process.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Trend 3 : When Automation Becomes a ‘Language’, Not just ‘Code’, True Collaboration Begins</strong></h2><p id="""">Only developers who could read a test script could join in automation discussions in the past. Now automation is becoming a tool for communicating with the entire team.</p><p id="""">Our collaboration features, such as integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams and shared dashboards, saw three times more usage than we projected. What’s especially remarkable is that because AskUI’s automation scripts are composed of human-readable, natural language like ‘Click the button with the shopping cart icon’, non-developers like PMs or designers can easily understand the test and actively participate in the quality conversation.</p><p id="""">When automation becomes a language for everyone, quality finally becomes a shared responsibility for the entire team, allowing true collaboration.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Future of Testing: Smarter, Faster and More open</strong></h2><p id="""">Based on the data, we can see a clear picture of 2026. The future of test automation is defined by visual stability that exceeds selectors, accelerated test creation with AI and open collaboration based on natural language.</p><p id="""">For us at AskUI, these insights are more than just interesting data points. They are a mandate from the community and the compass leading the future of Caesr.ai’s development as we work to build a platform that doesn’t just follow the future of testing, but helps create it.&nbsp; </p><p id="""">‍</p>","What's next for test automation?

The service owner executes the tests to make sure functionality does not break for a consumer.</li><li id="""">Producer driven: The microservice provides tests that emulate API requests potential consumers of the service can make.</li></ul><h3 id="""">Integration tests</h3><p id="""">Integration testing involves two or more microservices and focuses on the interaction between those services and not on the desired behavior. They test if the services can communicate with each other, third-party services and databases on an interface level.</p><h3 id="""">Component tests</h3><p id="""">In contrast to integration tests component tests focus on the behavior of two or more services that form a business function. They are therefore a form of acceptance test.</p><h3 id="""">End-to-end tests (E2E)</h3><p id="""">After ensuring that every service and every component of the system does what it should do E2E Tests make sure that the whole application fulfills the business objectives.</p><p id="""">With microservices, you can usually spin up an environment that is very close to production and implement test cases that map the whole user journey.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">Microservice architectures introduce a lot of operational complexity at the benefit of scalability and independent deployability. Testing becomes easier for each microservice in isolation while testing the whole user journey needs a more complex setup. Depending on the use case it may be enough to implement unit, contract, and component tests. If an E2E and/or integration approach is chosen a dedicated team QA team often is needed.</p>",The microservice architecture paradigm is constructing an application by breaking it into small independent services.

The AI Test Agent's Dilemma: Navigating the Ethical Challenges of Autonomous QA in 2025,ai-qa-ethics-dilemma-2025,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,6894895839a3256bbc8c396a,FALSE,FALSE,Thu Aug 07 2025 11:09:12 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Aug 07 2025 13:38:23 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sat Aug 23 2025 19:30:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">The rise of agentic AI has enabled developers to build and ship applications faster than ever before. But this speed introduces a critical dilemma: as AI agents take over Quality Assurance (QA), they bring complex ethical challenges that can undermine user trust. For Vibe Coders and AI builders who rapidly assemble products, generating clear proof that their app is robust and reliable is paramount. This guide explores the key ethical hurdles of autonomous QA and provides a framework for building trustworthy software in 2025.</p><h2 id="""">What are the main ethical challenges of AI test agents?</h2><p id="""">The primary ethical challenges are <strong id="""">algorithmic bias</strong>, <strong id="""">data privacy</strong>, and <strong id="""">accountability</strong>. AI test agents, if not properly managed, can create discriminatory user experiences, mishandle sensitive data, and leave a dangerous gap in responsibility when critical bugs are missed.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Algorithmic Bias:</strong> An AI agent trained on historical data may learn to prioritize testing common user paths, inadvertently ignoring edge cases critical for accessibility or minority user groups. This can result in an app that is technically functional but practically unusable for a portion of your audience.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Data Privacy:</strong> To be effective, QA agents often require access to production-like environments, which may contain sensitive user data. Ensuring this data is not exposed, leaked, or used improperly by an autonomous system is a significant security and ethical concern.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Accountability:</strong> If an AI agent gives a green light to a release that contains a major security flaw, who is responsible? The developer who deployed the agent? The provider of the AI model? This accountability vacuum is a major risk for development teams.</li></ul><h2 id="""">How can algorithmic bias affect UI testing?</h2><p id="""">Algorithmic bias in UI testing causes an AI to overlook or incorrectly assess interactions for less-common user groups. This leads to a product that fails on accessibility and inclusivity, directly damaging user trust and brand reputation.</p><p id="""">For example, a test agent might validate a checkout flow perfectly for mouse-based interactions because that's what it was trained on. However, it could completely miss that the same flow is broken for users relying on keyboard-only navigation or screen readers. This isn't a minor bug; it's a barrier that excludes users and exposes the business to legal and reputational risk.</p><h2 id="""">Who is accountable when an autonomous QA agent fails?</h2><p id="""">In 2025, accountability for a failed AI QA agent still largely falls on the <strong id="""">development team</strong> that implemented it. While legal frameworks are struggling to catch up, the responsibility to ship a safe and functional product remains with the builder.</p><p id="""">This creates a serious problem for developers who rely on ""black box"" AI tools. Without a clear audit trail of <em id="""">why</em> the AI made its decisions, it's nearly impossible to diagnose failures or prove due diligence. A purely autonomous agent that makes its own decisions offers speed but obscures responsibility, making it a risky choice for teams that need to build and maintain user trust.</p><h3 id="""">Table: Autonomous AI QA vs. Human-Guided Automation</h3><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><!DOCTYPE html>

The systems deliver exceptional productivity yet they create new security threats because of sophisticated attack techniques which include prompt injection attacks and unauthorized data theft by malicious agents. The most important question for engineers and architects is no longer if these systems will be attacked, but how fast we can validate their resilience.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">This technical guide provides a testing framework for agentic systems which goes past conventional security approaches. We will examine the modern threat landscape and provide actionable strategies to ensure robust agentic ai security.</p><h3 id="""">The New Threat Landscape: Why Traditional Security Isn't Enough</h3><p id="""">The new attacks on Agentic AI systems which use Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on disrupting the internal operations of the models instead of their physical infrastructure. The OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 for LLM Applications lists the following critical security vulnerabilities.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Prompt Injections:</strong> Attackers manipulate the LLM's instructions, causing the agent to perform unintended actions.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Insecure Output Handling:</strong> An agent might generate malicious code or commands that are then executed by other systems.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Model Denial of Service:</strong> Attackers can exploit an LLM's resource-intensive nature, causing performance degradation and high operational costs.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Sensitive Information Disclosure:</strong> Agents can be tricked into revealing confidential training data or user information.</li></ul><p id="""">The current security measures consisting of traditional firewalls and static code analysis fail to defend against these contemporary logic-based threats because they function dynamically. Organizations need to use an active approach for testing artificial intelligence systems because of the current circumstances.</p><h3 id="""">A Framework for Testing Agentic AI Resilience</h3><p id="""">A successful resilience development process requires continuous thorough testing at various levels of operation. Organizations should implement automated scanning tools together with ""Red Teaming"" exercises to achieve their best results in terms of efficiency.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Phase 1: Automated Vulnerability Scanning &amp; Fuzzing</strong></h4><p id="""">The first step is to establish a baseline of security. This involves using specialized <strong id="""">AI testing</strong> tools to automatically probe for common vulnerabilities.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Automated Scanners:</strong> Tools like Garak, an open-source LLM vulnerability scanner, can test for a wide range of common failure modes, including prompt injections, data leakage, and toxic language generation. These tools provide the fastest way to get an initial security posture assessment.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Fuzzing:</strong> This technique involves sending a high volume of unexpected or malformed inputs to the agent to test its <strong id="""">resilience</strong> and identify edge cases that could lead to crashes or unintended behavior.</li></ul><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Phase 2: Targeted LLM Red Teaming</strong></h4><p id="""">While automated tools are fast, they can't match the creativity of a human attacker. LLM Red Teaming is a form of ethical hacking where security engineers simulate real-world attacks to uncover more nuanced vulnerabilities.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Goal-Oriented Attack Simulation:</strong> Instead of just checking for generic flaws, a red team should be given specific, high-value goals, such as:<ul id=""""><li id="""">""Attempt to extract confidential API keys from the agent's context.""</li><li id="""">""Manipulate the agent into executing a file deletion command on the host system.""</li><li id="""">""Bypass the agent's safety filters to generate harmful content.""</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Adversarial Prompt Engineering:</strong> The red team will craft complex prompts designed to test the agent’s logic and guardrails, a critical step in modern <strong id="""">agentic ai security</strong>.</li></ul><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Phase 3: Measuring and Enhancing Resilience</strong></h4><p id="""">Testing is useless without measurement. To quantify <strong id="""">resilience</strong>, architects should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and use a structured evaluation framework.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Resilience Metrics:</strong><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Time-to-First-Failure (TTFF):</strong> How many adversarial prompts does it take to compromise the agent?</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Criticality of Failure:</strong> What is the impact of a successful attack (e.g., data leak vs. generating incorrect text)?</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Detection Rate:</strong> How effectively do your internal monitoring systems detect a simulated attack?</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Continuous Feedback Loop:</strong> The findings from red teaming and automated scanning must be fed back to the development team to strengthen the agent's defenses, such as improving input validation, refining system prompts, and restricting tool access.</li></ul><h3 id="""">Final Thoughts for Security Architects</h3><p id="""">Agentic AI security requires ongoing active protection through continuous testing and adaptation to achieve effective results. The fastest solution for security involves using automated scanning for wide coverage and red teaming for detailed vulnerability assessment.

The Challenge of Stuck Vision AI Agents,challenge-stuck-vision-ai-agents,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,6733542f51fe70bc5ab479cf,FALSE,FALSE,Tue Nov 12 2024 13:12:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 25 2024 08:48:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 25 2024 08:48:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">Vision AI agents have made significant strides in advancing technology, yet they face various limitations that can hinder their effectiveness. One recurring issue is the tendency for these agents to get ""stuck,"" leaving them unable to complete tasks efficiently. Understanding the causes and solutions to this problem can significantly enhance the functionality and deployment of vision AI agents.</p><h2 id="""">Agent Looping Challenges</h2><h2 id="""">Hallucinated or Non-Existent Tools</h2><p id="""">One major problem many vision AI agents face is looping—repeatedly executing the same process without achieving the desired outcome. Looping often occurs when an agent attempts to use a tool that does not exist or is inaccessible. This can be due to hallucinations in the agent's reasoning or errors related to tool availability. For example, an AI agent might attempt to access a weather API for an unsupported location, causing it to enter an endless loop of futile attempts.</p><h3 id="""">Tool Errors</h3><p id="""">A similar issue arises from errors encountered during tool execution. If an agent relies on APIs or computer vision models and encounters frequent errors like a 404 response or runtime exception, it may keep retrying the tool, resulting in infinite loops. This looping problem indicates a need for improved error-handling mechanisms to break these cycles.</p><h3 id="""">Incorrect Exit Conditions</h3><p id="""">Beyond errors and hallucinations, incorrect exit conditions within an agent's logic can propagate looping. Without clear termination criteria or decision-making rules, agents may continue executing tasks that may be completed. An example is when an agent tasked with entity extraction from text does not understand when to stop, continuously looping through tools despite having extracted all relevant entities.</p><h2 id="""">Prompt-Related Challenges: The Role of Clarity and Context</h2><h3 id="""">Ambiguous Prompts</h3><p id="""">The quality of user-prompts is pivotal in dictating an agent's success. Ambiguous instructions can lead to task confusion, resulting in agents selecting incorrect tools or following irrelevant paths. For instance, a prompt that merely asks an agent to “analyze this image” without clear specifications can trap the agent in a loop of trying different analyses without reaching a conclusion.</p><h3 id="""">Lack of Context</h3><p id="""">Hands-in-hand with ambiguous prompts are those that lack sufficient context. Without contextual information, agents struggle with decision-making, failing to appropriately select tools or make accurate determinations. This contextual deficiency can cripple an agent tasked with object identification in an image if it knows nothing of the scene or expected objects.</p><h2 id="""">Limitations in Planning and Reasoning</h2><h3 id="""">Narrow Problem Sets</h3><p id="""">Another layer of difficulty arises from limitations in an agent's planning and reasoning. Vision AI agents perform well in environments where problem sets are narrow, with tasks and inputs being predictable. However, once faced with complex or open-ended problems, their limited reasoning capabilities may lead to inefficient loops or errors in adapting to unforeseen circumstances.</p><h2 id="""">Addressing the Challenges: A Multifaceted Approach</h2><p id="""">To overcome the problem of vision AI agents becoming stuck, a multifaceted strategy is necessary:</p><h3 id="""">Refining Prompting Strategies</h3><p id="""">Crafting clear, specific, and context-rich prompts is vital. This involves incorporating domain-specific knowledge and giving explicit instructions on desired outcomes and tool selections.</p><h3 id="""">Improving Tool Selection and Execution</h3><p id="""">Providing access to a diverse range of robust tools is crucial. Handling tool failures and inaccuracies will involve incorporating error handling, dynamic tool selections, and fallback mechanisms.</p><h3 id="""">Enhancing Planning and Reasoning Capabilities</h3><p id="""">Advancements in AI, such as hierarchical planning, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning, are essential to improving decision-making and problem-solving skills in AI agents. These advancements would enable agents to tackle more complex tasks and adapt to novel situations.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">Addressing the challenge of stuck vision AI agents demands improvements in prompt design, tool execution, and agent decision-making capabilities. Through refining strategies and leveraging AI advancements, the path toward more efficient and effective vision AI systems becomes clearer.</p><p id="""">Recommended read: <a href=""http://www.askui.com/blog-posts/top-14-agentic-ai-tools"">Top 14 Agentic AI Tools</a></p>","Addressing the challenge of stuck vision AI agents demands improvements in prompt design, tool execution, and agent decision-making capabilities.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673353104bf30de764524e5f_Designer%20(58).webp,"The image depicts a futuristic concept of artificial intelligence, featuring a human-like figure with digital overlays.

This nifty creation is here to transform how we approach automated testing tools for web applications. </p><h2 id="""">Automation for the Non-Programmers</h2><p id="""">Have you ever wished you could talk to your computer like it was your personal assistant? Well, AskUI initially set out to bridge the gap between programmer and non-programmer by allowing folks to describe their automation intentions in plain English. Imagine telling your system, “Please click the Login button and enter my credentials,” and voilà! Your wish is the computer's command. </p><p id="""">AskUI is particularly concerned with relieving everyday users from repetitive UI tasks. Whether you're trying to log into social media without the fuss of typing passwords every single time or setting up routine workflows, AskUI enables even non-techies to wield the power of automation. Sorry, Selenium, you might have some stiff competition. </p><h2 id="""">From Web Application Testing to AI-Driven Testing</h2><p id="""">The journey to developing AskUI originated in an environment where the demand for round-the-clock reliable automation was essential. Armed with experience in software development, the creators were challenged by the limitations of existing automated testing tools like Selenium. Frustrated by these tools' shortcomings in managing diverse scenarios and platforms, they envisioned a solution that could leverage AI's visual and linguistic capabilities.</p><p id="""">In comes AskUI's approach: leveraging AI to understand and interact with visual elements and natural language. This combination, akin to a superhero duo, allows real-time UI element detection and action just by giving commands. Testing for web applications, meet your tech-savvy sidekick.</p><h2 id="""">Screenshot-Based Magic: When Seeing is Believing</h2><p id="""">Here’s where AskUI flips the script on traditional web scraping techniques. Rather than diving into the tangled web of source code, AskUI uses screenshots to interact with user interfaces. Yes, you read that right! By capturing the screen, their object detection model identifies elements such as buttons, fields, and icons directly from visual data.</p><p id="""">This screenshot-first approach allows AskUI to transcend the confines of web-specific interfaces, accommodating diverse environments like Android applications. It's as if Sherlock Holmes was giving your web app a detailed once-over, identifying elements and acting upon them with precision. </p><h2 id="""">A Glimpse into the Future of Automated Testing</h2><p id="""">The genius of AskUI lies in its uniqueness—combining visual recognition with natural language processing to execute tests that cover all bases. It’s like Google Translate for web applications, helping you articulate your intentions and observe as automation follows suit.</p><p id="""">But here's the kicker: askui doesn't just identify UI elements; it ties them into existing test desires. If your test requires a button press or text entry, AskUI makes the magic happen. Allowing testers to focus less on the murky details of coding and more on the big picture.</p><p id="""">In a world where automated testing tools for web applications are increasingly essential, AskUI stands out by making testing more intuitive and less mundane. So, the next time you're ready to break your keyboard trying to automate a test, remember that a screenshot and a polite request might just do the trick. After all, it's not about breaking the screen; it’s about taking a picture of it.</p>",If you've ever found yourself shouting at your computer screen because your automated testing script for a web application missed something important.,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/66ff9d3d93c3e52de313dd9e_Designer%20(1).jpeg,"A large, intricate robot sits surrounded by gears and machinery, symbolizing automation and technology.

They have memory, perform complex chains of reasoning, and interact with external tools, creating a new set of production challenges. This is the new frontier of <strong id="""">LLMOps</strong>, or Large Language Model Operations, which adapts traditional MLOps principles specifically for the unique lifecycle of LLM-powered applications</p><p id="""">As the team behind <a href=""https://www.caesr.ai/"" id="""">Caesr.ai</a>, we've engineered our platform to solve these exact scaling problems. This guide explores the real challenges of deploying complex LLM applications and introduces the key platforms that help you manage them effectively.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Real Challenge: Why Agentic AI Deployment is So Hard</strong></h3><p id="""">Deploying LLM applications at scale introduces unique problems that traditional CI/CD pipelines weren't built to handle. If you're an MLOps professional, these are the issues that keep you up at night:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">1. The ""Black Box"" Problem (Observability):</strong>When an agent fails, ""why"" is the hardest question to answer. Was it a bad prompt? A slow API call? A hallucination? You need robust tracing to see the agent's ""thoughts"" and debug its reasoning chain. This is a core pillar of <strong id="""">LLMOps</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">2. Complex State and Memory Management:</strong>Agents aren't stateless. They need to remember past interactions and manage long-running tasks. This creates a stateful environment that is much harder to scale and manage in a distributed system than a simple API endpoint.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">3. Environment and Tool Chaos:</strong>Agents rely on a complex web of external API keys, Python dependencies, and vector databases. Managing this environment, ensuring security, and handling versioning (e.g., what happens when an API the agent relies on changes?) is a nightmare.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">4. Cost and Latency:</strong>A single agentic query could trigger a cascade of 20 different LLM calls, potentially costing dollars and taking minutes to resolve. You need platforms that can cache results, track token usage, and enforce budgets to prevent runaway costs.</li></ul><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Platforms for Modern AI Deployment and LLMOps</strong></h3><p id="""">No single tool solves everything.

The Role of Vision Language Models (VLM) in Vision AI Agents,the-role-of-vlms-in-vision-ai-agents,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,67448898b16e6567c46f885b,FALSE,TRUE,Mon Nov 25 2024 14:24:24 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Fri Mar 28 2025 12:41:19 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,"<p id="""">Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are emerging as critical components in the development of intelligent visual AI agents. By enabling these agents to process and understand both visual and textual information simultaneously, VLMs open the door to more dynamic, context-aware applications. This blog explores the role of VLMs in shaping the intelligent agents of today and tomorrow.</p><h2 id="""">What Are Vision-Language Models?</h2><p id="""">Vision-Language Models are a class of AI models designed to integrate and process visual data (e.g., images, videos) along with natural language input. They play an essential role by bridging the gap between two key modalities humans interact with: vision and language. Rather than treating these modalities separately, VLMs allow AI agents to form a coherent understanding by combining both sources of information.</p><p id="""">For instance, when a user provides an image alongside a textual query, intelligent agents leveraging VLMs can process the image’s content and interpret the language in context. This seamless integration enables more sophisticated applications than single-modality systems.</p><h2 id="""">Key Features of VLMs in AI Applications</h2><p id="""">1. <strong>Enhanced Multimodal Understanding</strong>: VLMs enable visual AI agents to understand relationships between text and visual elements, such as identifying objects in an image based on a caption. This capability allows for tasks like generating detailed image descriptions or answering queries about visual contexts.<br>2. <strong>Improved Contextual Reasoning:</strong> By combining vision and language, agents armed with VLMs can perform higher-level reasoning. For instance, they can make contextual inferences (“Who is likely to win this soccer match based on past performance?”) by analyzing both visual cues (team uniforms, scores) and relevant textual data (historical game results).<br>3. <strong>Solution Optimization Across Diverse Use Cases</strong>: From assisting with complex decision-making in professional workflows to optimizing customer-facing interactions like AI chatbots or virtual assistants, VLMs expand the practical range of intelligent visual agents.</p><h2 id="""">Applications of VLMs in Intelligent Agents</h2><h3 id="""">1. Interactive Virtual Assistants</h3><p id="""">Visual AI agents equipped with VLMs can better respond to users’ needs when visual and language cues are both involved. For example, an assistant can perform tasks like retrieving relevant data from a chart or answering product-related questions using a visual input.</p><h3 id="""">2. Autonomous Systems</h3><p id="""">The integration of VLMs into robotics or self-driving systems allows these agents to independently interpret road signs, traffic patterns, or visual obstacles while correlating this information with navigational instructions.</p><h3 id="""">3. Creative Content Generation</h3><p id="""">Another emerging area is the use of VLMs in creative domains. Intelligent agents can now generate descriptions of images, synthesize captions, or even create entirely new visuals based on a specific language prompt.</p><h3 id="""">4. Accessibility Improvements</h3><p id="""">For individuals requiring accessibility tools, visual AI agents using VLMs can bridge communication gaps by “reading aloud” visual content or providing contextual language descriptions for video and image inputs.</p><h2 id="""">Why Vision-Language-Model Integration Matters for Intelligent Agents</h2><p id="""">The real power of VLMs lies in their ability to elevate the understanding and usability of AI agents. As these models grow more advanced, they enable intelligent agents to engage deeply with the world, whether through precise image categorization, contextual understanding of multimedia inputs, or implementing nuanced visual solutions.<br><br>Moreover, combining vision and language aligns AI closer to human cognition, where multimodal inputs from sight and speech are processed together seamlessly. This approach vastly enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of visual AI systems.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">Vision-Language Models play a crucial role in advancing the intelligence of visual AI agents, enabling them to process and respond to multimodal inputs effectively. As this technology continues to evolve, its potential applications across industries promise to make AI a more integral, useful part of our daily lives. Exploring and refining VLMs will remain a focal point for achieving more intelligent, human-like AI agents in the future.<br></p>","A vibrant and futuristic illustration features a side profile of a human head filled with intricate and colorful circuitry patterns, symbolizing artificial intelligence and technology.

True Self-Healing Capabilities</strong></h3><p id="""">This is the direct result of visual recognition. When a UI element's properties change, an AI system can intelligently locate the ""new"" version of that element during the test run. This creates true <strong id="""">self-healing tests</strong> that automatically adapt without human intervention, dramatically increasing the resilience of your test suite.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">3. Contextual Understanding</strong></h3><p id="""">Modern <strong id="""">AI test automation</strong> understands the relationships between elements. It knows a ""password"" field is usually preceded by a ""username"" field and followed by a ""login"" button. This contextual awareness helps it make smarter decisions when the UI changes.</p><h2 id="""">AskUI in Action: A Practical Example</h2><p id="""">At AskUI, our entire platform is built on this vision-first principle. Our AI agent doesn't need to know the ID or XPath of an element. You simply describe what you want it to do in plain language.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Traditional Script:</strong> <code id="""">cy.get('#user-login-form &gt; .btn-primary').click()</code></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">AskUI Instruction:</strong> <code id="""">await aui.click().button().withText('Login').exec()</code></li></ul><p id="""">If a developer changes the button's class from <code id="""">.btn-primary</code> to <code id="""">.btn-submit</code>, the traditional script fails instantly. The AskUI instruction continues to work perfectly because it's looking for the visual element a button with the text ""Login.""</p><h2 id="""">Final Thoughts: The Future is Resilient</h2><p id="""">While traditional test automation tools laid the groundwork, they weren't designed for the reality of today's fast-moving, <strong id="""">dynamic UI</strong> environments. The constant maintenance and <strong id="""">flaky tests</strong> are a symptom of a rigid, outdated approach.</p><p id="""">By shifting from code-based locators to human-like visual understanding, <strong id="""">AI test automation</strong> offers a more resilient path forward. It's an approach that creates genuine <strong id="""">self-healing tests</strong>, freeing teams from the cycle of endless script maintenance to focus on what truly matters: delivering a high-quality, bug-free user experience.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">About the AskUI Content Team</strong></h2><p id="""">This article was written and fact-checked by the AskUI Content Team.

Nonetheless, testing desktop apps becomes reasonably important when in complex enterprise environments, the developers work over sophisticated legacy systems. </p><p id="""">Desktop applications need installation and configuration, followed by execution on a desktop OS, which could be macOS, Linux, or Windows. Hence, for desktop applications to be operational, end-users need to use a PC or a laptop that features sufficient hardware resources.</p><p id="""">The technologies most frequently used to build desktop applications include Java (JavaFX, SWT, AWT, and Swing), .NET (VB.NET, WinForms, WPF, and UWP), GDI, Visual Basic, MFC, Visual C++, SAPGUI, PowerBuilder, Oracle Forms, DevExpress, Telerik, Infragistics, Cocoa, and Xlib.</p><p id="""">In this article, we will go through a list of the finest Automation tools that automate the desktop app’s functional testing.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">1. WinAppDriver</strong></h2><p id="""">It is over the WebDriver protocol that WinAppDriver has been built. For mobile and web app testing, it is the gold standard. WinAppDriver is ideal for driving any Windows app. They include classic Windows controls (Win32), WinForms, WPF, and UWP. These Windows apps may be using a range of language bindings such as C#, Python, Java, or Ruby, or test runners such as MSTest, Nunit, or JUnit, etc.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">2. Winium</strong></h2><p id="""">For WPF and WinForms app testing, Winium is an open-source Test Automation framework. Just as in the case of WinAppDriver, Winium is also based on the WebDriver protocol. But upon comparison, Winium may not be able to match up with WinAppDriver in several areas. Since 2016, Winium has not been maintained actively, so a tester has to add improvements or fix bugs by themself.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">3. TestArchitect</strong></h2><p id="""">With TestArchitect being a testing tool driven by keywords, even a tester whose programming skills are modest can learn using the tool quickly. The tool makes an extensive keyword library available. Furthermore, the TechArchitect features Action-based testing, a modern testing method driven by keywords. Across recent years, TechArchitect has appeared in Forrester Research reports as well. The depth and width of support and high usability offered by TechArchitect make it relatively stronger as compared to open source solutions.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">4. Ranorex</strong></h2><p id="""">As a test automation tool, Ranorex has been in the market for a long time. Anorex offers proprietary Automation technologies that aid with the automation of mobile apps, web apps, and desktop apps. In particular, in the Japanese markets, Ranorex enjoys a strong presence, because of their reliable record &amp; playback, and Japanese localization.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">5. Tricentis Tosca</strong></h2><p id="""">In the case of Tricentis Tosca, wide support is made available for virtually all test activities. Tosca offers a Continuous Testing platform for the customers. This covers test data management, service virtualization, API testing, UI testing, and test design. Tosca has recently acquired QASymphony (qTest). Here, they further expanded their scope to test management. In particular, the manual testers who intend to transition to automation testing engineers should be using Tosca.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">6. SmartBear TestComplete</strong></h2><p id="""">SmartBear TestComplete has been in the automation market since 1999. This makes SmartBear one of the veterans. In the case of TestComplete (TC), one accesses a comprehensive solution covering mobile, web, and desktop. TC has also recently added a hybrid UI matching method that combines object recognition and visual recognition. The testing method of TC is keyword-driven, and even the non-technical testers can use it.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">7. Micro Focus UFT (formerly HP QTP)</strong></h2><p id="""">UFT/QTP is a unique suite of testing tools for being the oldest tools to still survive in the automation market. As a powerful UI testing tool, UFT makes it easier for you to test an elaborate range of platforms, including mobile, SAP, web services, web, and desktop. Furthermore, UFT/QTP seamlessly integrates with HP Quality Center. In a single flow, one can run end-to-end cross-platform tests jumping from API to desktop, mobile, and web.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">8. SikuliX</strong></h2><p id="""">As an open-source tool, SkiuliX uses OCR and image recognition to automate all things visible on the screen. Nevertheless, the default use case of SikuliX is small projects since it has been designed for automating mundane tasks on Windows. Still, upon scaling up, you’d come across unsolvable problems. These problems occur because of the nature of image recognition techniques. In essence, image recognition is slower than object recognition.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">9. AskUI</strong></h2><p id="""">AskUI simulates the actions of a human tester and can find any UI element visible on your operating system.

With the emergence of powerful tools like GPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs), businesses now have a remarkable resource to expedite these critical processes. In this article, we would like to share our vision for AskUI and its potential integration with LLMs, illustrating how it could redefine real-world applications.<br><br>Check out the original here: <a href=""https://gitlostmurali.com/machine-learning/product-development/llms-prototype"">LLMs Prototype</a></p><h2 id="""">Catering to Enterprises</h2><p id="""">AskUI is a UI automation tool. While many might think of Selenium when they hear “user automation,” AskUI goes beyond it. Traditional tools like Selenium are dependent on the underlying website’s code. But what happens when the code changes? Or when you need to automate tasks on desktop applications? Enter AskUI, which leverages vision-based techniques, similar to human perception, to identify elements. So, it sees things like a human and you can ask it as if you ask your testing team to test specific actions like clicking a red button or signup button. Through object detection and other advanced methods, AskUI stands out as a robust automation tool that’s not just limited to web applications.</p><h2 id="""">Empowering Natural Language</h2><p id="""">One of the distinctive attributes of AskUI is its user-friendly Domain Specific Language (DSL). For instance, a command like 'aui.click().button().withText(""Hello World"").exec();' is designed to be self-explanatory. However, by aiming to cater to a broader audience, including financial analysts at esteemed institutions and everyday individuals, we've recognized the potential for a more intuitive interaction. Our goal is to seamlessly convert natural language instructions into AskUI DSL commands.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1c65844577ca2f93295_652ce04179b85b7192f3c27b_intro2dsl.jpeg"" alt=""Translating Natural Language to DSL"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Translating Natural Language to DSL</figcaption></figure><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1c65844577ca2f93292_652ce041722f7ce55d0c4e7c_askui_dsl.png"" alt=""AskUI framework DSL"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">AskUI framework DSL</figcaption></figure><p id="""">Rather than immediately diving into the complexities of building a machine translation model, we've turned to the capabilities of GPT and LLMs. By feeding them our documentation and list of commands, we were able to quickly prototype a system that translates natural language step into our DSL. We just had to provide the existing functions (like get, await, etc.), end goal, and GPT would generate the entire workflow. For instance, if the goal was to <strong id="""">“click on the SignUp button”</strong> GPT would generate the following DSL commands: <code id="""">aui.click().button().withText(""SignUp"").exec();</code>.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1c65844577ca2f9329f_652ce041ac2fb6a71ae3bc8c_nli2dsl.png"" alt=""Natural Language to DSL Demo"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Natural Language to DSL Demo</figcaption></figure><p id="""">The results were beyond translation; they demonstrated GPT's potential to not just interpret, but strategically plan and execute entire workflows based on a defined end goal. It's a remarkable prospect that could represent a transformative moment for us. We could now potentially leverage GPT to generate workflows for our users, granting them the flexibility to fine-tune and customize these workflows as needed. This approach isn't just about time-saving; it's about enabling users to maintain their focus on their ultimate goals, free from the intricacies of the steps required to achieve them.</p><h2 id="""">Streamlining Workflows with Vision</h2><p id="""">Expanding on this vision, we've imagined a future where users may not even need to explicitly type commands. With AskUI’s workflows, users can define a series of steps using screenshots. For each step, they specify the action, and our engine executes it. But what if we could automate this specification process? What if users can just perform what action is supposed to happen and the corresponding askui command is stored internally?</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1c65844577ca2f932a4_652ce0411d03208622af7fb1_click2command.jpeg"" alt=""Easy Worflow: Click to command conversion"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Easy Workflow: Click to command conversion</figcaption></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">In this scenario, the AskUI inference engine identifies all visible UI elements on the screen. As the engine also provides the positions of the identified elements, we use the click coordinates and map them to the corresponding element’s position. And then, using the result and the relevant documentation as context, GPT can then generate the corresponding DSL command. This approach can enhance and streamline the workflow creation process, which in turn will greatly improve the users’ experience with AskUI.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">The transformative integration of AskUI with LLMs like GPT has shown us the possibility to reshape UI automation, offering an intuitive, efficient, and powerful tool for achieving the users’ automation goals.

Unlike a scripted automation step, agents:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Understand <strong id="""">goals</strong>, not just sequences</li><li id="""">Interpret <strong id="""">visual and contextual cues</strong> in real-time</li><li id="""">Adapt their actions based on current UI state</li><li id="""">Navigate and recover from unexpected application behavior</li></ul><p id="""">Agents like those in <strong id="""">AskUI</strong> are built to operate independently of application code, enabling test coverage even in environments where traditional tools fail. Rather than locating a button by CSS selector, an agent visually identifies a ""Login"" button based on label text, layout position, and screen semantics—even if the DOM changes.</p><h2 id="""">How Do Agents Operate in a QA Workflow?</h2><p id="""">Agents are designed to be embedded directly in QA workflows as flexible executors of user intent.

This is the first of two blog posts covering Unit Testing. By the end of this post you will have an overview of all the important characteristics, techniques and patterns.</p><p id="""">Let’s start with a quote by Martin Fowler:</p><blockquote id="""">“Every fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans understand.”</blockquote><p id="""">Analogous, good Unit Tests are comprehensible to other people, not just machines. Making code and in this case Unit Tests comprehensible to everyone is what we want to call the <em id="""">Art of Unit Testing</em>.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Why do you need to test?</strong></h2><ol id=""""><li id="""">Write working code</li><li id="""">Keep code working</li><li id="""">Develop faster</li><li id="""">Find bugs before production</li><li id="""">Force us to write testable code</li><li id="""">Humans do mistakes</li></ol><p id="""">There are six reasons, the most obvious answer (1) is that you want your code to work properly. But you need to make sure that it (2) keeps working, even when you change the code. Even the tiniest changes can lead to a series of unintended errors. You don’t want your users to find bugs, you want to (3) find bugs before production. The release cycles of updates heavily increased over the last years which means that the (4) development-process needs to be done more quickly. A well written test is the foundation to this. (5) Writing testable code from the beginning is an investment that pays off in the long run, the amount of work just piles up over time. Last but not least, (6) humans make mistakes. Making mistakes is not a problem, not finding them is a problem.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">How Are Unit Tests defined?</strong></h2><p id="""">There are various different definitions of Unit Tests, so let’s stick to Martin Fowler one more time, who identified <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html"" id="""">three core characteristics of Unit Tests</a> that every definition shares: Firstly there is a notion that unit tests are low-level, focusing on a small part of the software system. Secondly unit tests are usually written by the programmers themselves using their language dependent unit testing framework, like JUnit, MSTest or NUnit. Thirdly unit tests are expected to be significantly faster than other kinds of tests.</p><p id="""">Elliotte Rusty Harold stripped the definition of Unit Tests down to: “verifying that a known fixed input produces a known fixed output”.<br>But first step back. What is a unit in general? A unit is normally a method, constructor or deconstructor.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:884px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""884px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1cc84553c9eae9952d3_63218adf9a57ac0d19c52353_call-dependencies-in-units.png"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Call dependencies between units</figcaption></figure><p id="""">Units that are to be tested often rely on other units to fulfill their behavior.

Then verify calls with expected parameters</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id="""">What Is the FIRST-Principle?</h2><p id="""">When it comes to the properties of Unit Testing, <a href=""http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Brett Schuchert and Tim Ottinger</a> came up with the <strong id="""">FIRST Principle</strong>: <strong id="""">F</strong>ast, <strong id="""">I</strong>ndependent, <strong id="""">R</strong>epeatable, <strong id="""">S</strong>elf-Checking and <strong id="""">T</strong>imely. Writing your Unit Tests with these properties in mind keeps your code clean.</p><p id="""">Your Unit Test has to be <strong id="""">fast</strong>. Most projects cover hundreds of thousands of tests. A test that takes 0.5 or even 0.25 seconds to complete is unacceptably slow. Time is money, make your tests as fast as possible.</p><p id="""">An <strong id="""">independent</strong> test does not rely on any subset in a specific order. You can run every test without constraint. Passing or failing should not depend on the order in which the test was run. Tim Ottinger also refers to the “I” in FIRST as isolated.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Repeatable</strong> means that tests must be able to be run repeatedly without intervention. They must not depend upon a specific initial state and they must not leave any problems behind that would prevent them from being re-run. They have to be run repeatedly in any order at any time.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Self-checking</strong> or <strong id="""">self-validating</strong> means that a test can automatically detect if it was passed or failed. There is no additional instance needed to confirm or validate the result.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Tests</strong> are written at the right time, immediately before the code that makes the tests pass. Writing the test first makes a difference, don’t write them after you write your code.</p><h2 id="""">Do You Know Your Test Coverage?</h2><p id="""">Let’s talk about <strong id="""">Code Coverage</strong> or <strong id="""">Test Coverage</strong> as some like to call it. Coverage shows you which lines and branches of the code were (or were not) covered by the tests. It is also a metric which helps you to find out the percentage of your covered (executed) code by the tests. E.g.: It tells you that your codebase consists of 10 lines, 8 lines were being covered by your tests, so your coverage is 80%. While this gives you no information about the quality of your software or how good your tests really are. The coverage of the complete code base should be higher than 80%.</p><p id="""">Code coverage is useful for core refactoring, too. Execute it before you start, check which code branches are covered, add the missing tests and start refactoring your tests.</p><h2 id="""">What Is the Best Way to Write Unit Tests?</h2><p id="""">Last but not least: how should your Unit Tests be written? What are the Do’s and Don’ts, what do the naming conventions and building patterns look like and how is the code structured? Let’s start by prefacing some general tips before you actually start writing your code.<br>In the FIRST-Principle we already came across the term<em id=""""> clean code</em>. The term deviates from the Clean Code book by Robert Cecil Martin. In a nutshell, clean code is any code that can be understood intuitively – by others, not just by yourself. Next up is Dependency Injection (DI) – it’s not necessary but highly recommended to isolate your dependencies in the code. This allows you to easily inject your mocks to your class and only test the unit.</p><p id="""">Some general Do’s you should consider:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">One assert per test method</li><li id="""">Share setup and fixture</li><li id="""">Multiple test classes per class</li></ul><p id="""">Avoid these Don’ts:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Generate random input</li><li id="""">Access network or file system</li><li id="""">Names constants from model code. </li><li id="""">Conditions</li><li id="""">Using description annotations</li></ul><p id="""">First code example: to avoid god testing classes you can split your test class in multiple test classes. Then test only a single method in your test class, as shown in the next code example.</p><pre></pre><p id="""">Second code example: Never ever (!) use conditions or loops in test methods. Each test method should only test one test case. Split them in multiple test methods.</p><pre></pre><p id="""">Third code example: Warning! When you call static methods from external dependencies, the behavior is not only changed in this test method it is also changed in all other test methods. If you run them at the same time it can result in flaky tests.</p><pre></pre><h2 id="""">Have You Already Thought About Naming Your Test Methods?</h2><p id="""">Talking about intuitive, clean and easy to understand code (for everybody), let’s have a look at a few common naming conventions for test methods. There are some general recommendations regarding <a href=""https://medium.com/@stefanovskyi/unit-test-naming-conventions-dd9208eadbea"" target=""_blank"" id="""">test naming</a> (Stefanovskiy):</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Test name should express a specific requirement</li><li id="""">Test name could include the expected input or state and the expected result for that input or state</li><li id="""">Test name should be presented as a statement or fact of life that expresses workflows and outputs</li><li id="""">Test name could include the name of the tested method or class</li></ul><p id="""">An example might be:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">&lt;MethodName&gt;_&lt;StateUnderTest&gt;_&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;<br>isEighteen_AgeGreaterThan18_True<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>Renaming of method name is necessary, when renaming the origin method<br>‍</li><li id="""">&lt;MethodName&gt;_&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;_&lt;StateUnderTests&gt;<br>isEighteen_True_AgeGreaterThan18<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>Renaming of method name is necessary, when renaming the origin method<br>‍</li><li id="""">test[Feature being tested]<br>testIsEighteenIfAgeGreaterThan18<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>test-prefix is duplicated information in combination of an @Test-annotation <br>‍</li><li id="""">Feature to be tested<br>isEighteenIfAgeGreaterThan18<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>Expected result is not defined<br>‍</li><li id="""">Should_&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;_When_&lt;StateUnderTest&gt;<br>Should_True_When_AgeGreaterThan18<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>Long name through should and when</li><li id="""">When_&lt;StadeUnderTest&gt;_Expect_&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;<br>When_AgeGreaterThan18_True<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>Long name through should and expect<br>‍</li><li id="""">Given_&lt;Prediction&gt;_When_&lt;StateUnderTest&gt;_Then_&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;<br>Give_UserIsUnder18_When_AgeGreaterThan18_Then_False<br><strong id="""">Cons:</strong><br>Given, When and then are duplicated</li></ol><p id="""">It does not matter which naming convention you choose, but your team should use one consistently. Personally I prefer a combination of 1 and 5 &lt;MethodName&gt;_Should_&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;_When_&lt;StateUnderTest&gt;.</p><h2 id="""">Do You Know These Test Doubles?</h2><p id="""">When writing your code, knowing the following terms is crucial:</p><h3 id="""">Dummy</h3><p id="""">The most basic term you have to know is the Dummy. A Dummy is a placeholder required to pass the unit. The Dummy should not be accessed during the test. The simplest example might be null:</p><pre></pre><h3 id="""">Fake</h3><p id="""">In automated testing it is common to use objects that implement the production interface and behave like it. Fakes are objects that have working implementations, but not the same as the production one. Fakes simplify the complexity of the external dependency setup. Fakes are frequently used for database access, openid connect endpoints or external APIs.</p><pre></pre><h3 id="""">Stub</h3><p id="""">Stub is an object that holds predefined data and uses it to answer calls during tests. It provides indirect input to the unit from a dependency. Classic examples are objects, exceptions or primitive values which are returned from a method call.</p><pre></pre><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mock</strong></h3><p id="""">Compared to a stub, allow mocks to verifying method invocation of the unit. An example is the service method invoking the repository method. </p><pre></pre><h3 id="""">Spy</h3><p id="""">A Spy uses the original implementation and is the most complex version of a test double. It is a wrapper of the original implementation, so it records the number of calls and not the input. For example:</p><pre></pre><h2 id="""">How Are Test Methods Structured?</h2><p id="""">There are two common practices to structure your test method. First the AAA-Pattern and the BDD-Pattern. The BDD-Pattern is not covered here.<br><br>The AAA-Pattern is commonly used in unit tests. This Acronym stands for <em id="""">arrange, act and assert</em> (Bill Wake). The test method code is structured in three blocks, as shown in the following example.</p><pre></pre><p id="""">Now let’s come to a conclusion. Unit Testing is an art that is easy to learn (and not too hard to master) if you follow the instructions given in this overview. Now that you know about all the characteristics, basic coding examples and patterns, we suggest you to always question your code (as Fowler would say): is my code comprehensible to everyone?</p><p id="""">This blog is based on a Unit Test input Dominik Klotz gave for the <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/software-testing-karlsruhe/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Karlsruher Testing Community</a>.</p>","Everything you need to know about Unit Tests: Definitions, FIRST-Principle, Test Coverage, Code Examples,Naming Conventions,Test Doubles and Patterns.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/671a0ae16d415eebeb2a2f8c_unittesting.webp,Glasses lying in front of laptop display,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/671a0ae16d415eebeb2a2f8c_unittesting.webp,Glasses lying in front of laptop display,,FALSE,63b41086d222e72d7ec4f1b5,63b41086d222e720c3c4f357,Wed Sep 14 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Mar 29 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Mar 29 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),tutorials,dominik-klotz,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Not only is it used for unit testing, it is also highly relevant for integration tests. But we’ll get to that.<br>Let’s start with a simple JUnit test. As you may know from the <a href=""https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/unit-testing-in-a-nutshell/"" id="""">first part of this unit testing series</a>, a unit test method should be structured by the <strong id="""">Arrange</strong>,<strong id=""""> Act</strong>,<strong id=""""> Assert-Pattern </strong>(AAA). Here’s an example:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">In line 1 is the test suite in form of a Java class. The <em id="""">@Test</em>-Annotation in line 2 allows the JUnit-Runtime to find and execute the test case. The naming convention <em id="""">Should&lt;ExpectedBehavior&gt;When&lt;StateUnderTest&gt;</em> is used as a method name. Then we arrange the test method after the AAA-pattern. Experts usually don’t necessarily stick to this pattern, instead I recommend one liners to reduce the amount of code.</p><h2 id="""">JUnit Lifecycle</h2><p id="""">Let’s have a closer look at the functionality of JUnit, starting with its <strong id="""">lifecycle</strong>. What would you guess, how many instances of a test suite with two methods with a <em id="""">@Test</em>-Annotation are started? One or two? The correct answer is two. The JUnit-Engine starts by default for each <em id="""">@Test</em>-annotation method and its own instance. This behavior can be changed to one instance per class with the @TestInstance-Annotation.<br>Why is this important? You can clean up your test code and replace the <em id="""">@BeforeAll</em> method and initialize your ClassUnderTest directly in line 2, because you know now that JUnit starts a new instance for each test method so the ClassUnderTest has not been reset before the test run. </p><pre></pre><h2 id="""">Assumptions, Conditions and Disabling</h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Assumptions</strong> allow you to abort a test by a condition, instead of marking them as failed. &nbsp;For example, when you have a case where a test should only be executed in the CI pipeline with some special credentials, then the following code snippet is the correct choice:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">Instead of aborting a test, it can also be <strong id="""">disabled</strong> by the <em id="""">@Disabled</em> annotation.This is pretty intuitive, but you can also disable a test using a <strong id="""">condition</strong>. Imagine you have a code which is only working for a minimum JRE version, then you can disable it with the following code snippet:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">JUnit also provides the possibility to enable or disable the test based on an OS (<em id="""">@EnableOnOS</em>, <em id="""">@DisabledOnOs</em>), on SystemProperty (<em id="""">@EnabledIfSystemProperty</em>, &nbsp;<em id="""">@DisabledIfSystemProperty</em>), on Environment Variables (<em id="""">@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable</em>, <em id="""">@DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable</em>) or you can implement a custom condition (<em id="""">@EnabledIf</em>, &nbsp;<em id="""">@DisabledIf</em>)</p><h2 id="""">Test Order</h2><p id="""">In some cases the <strong id="""">order</strong> of the executed tests are important. This is especially necessary for integration tests or functional tests. Therefore the <em id="""">@TestMethodOrder</em>-Annotation allows you to choose one of the four ordering methods: <em id="""">@DisplayName</em>, <em id="""">@OrderAnnotation</em>, <em id="""">@Random</em> or <em id="""">@MethodName</em>. Be careful though, this annotation should only be used in conjunction with the class lifecycle (<em id="""">@TestInstance</em>(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)).Here is a small example:</p><pre></pre><h2 id="""">Repeating Tests, Parameterizing and File System Access</h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Repeating</strong> a test multiple times is unusual, but <em id="""">@RepeatTest</em>-Annotation allows you to do just this. Can you think of a practical case where this is necessary?</p><p id="""">The <em id="""">@ParameterizedTest</em>-Annotation on the other hand is frequently used to check all boundary values of a method. For example, if you want to check if your constructor only accept values from 0 – 10, you can type:</p><pre></pre><p id="""">In these two tests, you have tested all two valid and invalid boundary values for the constructor.<em id="""">@EnumSource</em>, <em id="""">@CsvFileSource</em> or <em id="""">@MethodSource</em> are popular available argument sources. For more information have a look at <a href=""https://www.baeldung.com/parameterized-tests-junit-5"" id="""">this tutorial by Baeldung</a>.</p><p id="""">In my previous blog post I gave the advice to not access the file system during a test.

It can generate tests during runtime. Maybe you are wondering why this is considered exciting. Sometimes you want to test high level requirements, like all REST endpoints should accept XML and JSON data formats.

In these cases, dynamic tests are a great solution to &nbsp;generate the test code for each endpoint.

Unleashing the Power of Automation Testing: The Machine Learning Revolution,unleashing-the-power-of-automation-testing-the-machine-learning-revolution,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,66ffa75e680f0e21d7bcb31e,FALSE,FALSE,Fri Oct 04 2024 08:29:18 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 11 2024 10:52:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 11 2024 10:52:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">The world of automation testing is like a turbo-charged freight train, and with machine learning as its trusty engine, nothing can stop it. Not even that pesky Windows 98 PC still humming in the back room of your office. Remember when ""automation"" meant automating web tasks on just one browser? Well, those days are over. Enter: automation testing with machine learning—a game-changer for every operating system under the sun (or at least the ones you care about).</p><p id="""">Here’s why: picture a controller snuggled comfortably in your local system, mingling with your operating system. It snaps a screenshot like a tourist with a new camera, takes the all-important click instruction, and sends it to an inference backend. The result? The mouse slides to the precise spot on your screen like a human finger. It's virtually the next-level click trick, and your workflows will adore the simplicity.</p><h2 id="""">Expanding Beyond Selenium</h2><p id="""">And hold your horses, Selenium fans! We have some jaw-dropping news. This tech marries the precision of machine learning with the everyday practicalities of Selenium. But unlike the latter, it operates on Windows, Mac, and iOS. Plus, it ventures into the mysterious world of legacy Windows applications, like a digital Indiana Jones, and streamlines the archaic processes there too.</p><h2 id="""">AI as Your Flexible Friend</h2><p id="""">Now, here's where things get exciting (and a bit sci-fi): AI technology transforms these scripts into super-flexible, hyper-smart agents. They learn from the ocean of available data, intuitively grasping what needs to be done without you spelling every single instruction. Whether it's user interface regression tests or leaping into the realm of robotic process automation, your automation testing with machine learning is as versatile as a Swiss Army knife. Instead of merely looking for web elements like a common browser detective, you can automate mind-numbing tasks like transferring data between forms with minimal human tears.</p><p id="""">Imagine this, if you will: You have a PDF on one side of your screen and a form on the other. Traditionally, you'd be the sad soul copying and pasting all day long. But here comes our automation hero—your trusted machine learning tool—eagerly filling in the details like a seasoned secretary. Throw in some large language models with a penchant for understanding human languages, and you’re looking at systems that might soon rival a college student’s efficiency during finals week.</p><h2 id="""">Historical Work Drones and Beyond</h2><p id="""">But wait, there's more! Ever thought of using your system as a ""historical work drone""? Picture this: a quiet recorder that takes screenshots of your daily tasks, storing historical records without judgment. It learns your repetitive tasks, and, like an apprentice, progresses to perfecting them automatically. Missed those morning reports four times over the last week? That's cute—it’s got your back.</p><h2 id="""">A Symphony of Operating Systems</h2><p id="""">Then there's Chris Benson, who brings up a good point about these multiverse-crossing platforms. Is the secret flexibility really just in those nifty screenshots? Perhaps. In essence, if you can capture what’s on your screen, you can control it—whether it's an iOS device, an ancient Linux terminal, or that aforementioned Windows relic. This approach levels the playing field in automation testing with machine learning, allowing developers and testers to become language-agnostic maestros conducting a symphony of operating systems.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">So, the takeaway? Automation testing with machine learning is your golden ticket to more efficient processes, less human error, and infinitely less frustration. They're smart, they're flexible, and yes, they might just revolutionize the way you see automation. Train your systems well, and soon enough, you’ll be wondering how you ever survived the pre-learning ages.</p>","The world of automation testing is like a turbo-charged freight train, and with machine learning as its trusty engine, nothing can stop it.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/66ffa721cea3bfc46203bbe0_Designer%20(4).jpeg,"A futuristic steam locomotive traveling on neon-lit tracks through a digital landscape, surrounded by floating holographic screens and high-tech devices.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/66ffa721cea3bfc46203bbe0_Designer%20(4).jpeg,"A futuristic steam locomotive traveling on neon-lit tracks through a digital landscape, surrounded by floating holographic screens and high-tech devices.",,FALSE,,,Mon Oct 07 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Oct 07 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Oct 07 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),academy,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Vision Agents: The Eyes of Neurosymbolic AI,vision-agents-the-eyes-of-neurosymbolic-ai,6630f90f27c76c1f85cdcbc1,6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e6,673b16be5b82312b63900420,FALSE,TRUE,Mon Nov 18 2024 10:28:14 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Nov 18 2024 10:28:14 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,"<p id="""">The world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the midst of a transformation. While traditional AI methodologies, such as deep learning, have achieved great success in image recognition and natural language processing, they grapple with challenges like common sense reasoning and transparency. Enter neurosymbolic AI—a promising new approach that blends the learning capabilities of deep learning with the logical reasoning of symbolic AI. In this context, vision agents stand out as particularly significant.</p><h2 id="""">Understanding Vision Agents</h2><p id="""">Vision agents are intelligent agent AI systems designed to perceive the world through visual inputs. Essentially, they're the ""eyes"" of AI, allowing machines to interpret their surroundings visually. While conventional vision systems have excelled at tasks like identifying objects and classifying images, they often fall short on context understanding. This gap is where neurosymbolic AI can make a substantial difference.</p><h2 id="""">The Role of Neurosymbolic AI</h2><p id="""">By integrating symbolic reasoning with visual capabilities, vision agents can move beyond mere image processing to actual comprehension. Imagine a self-driving car not only capable of detecting pedestrians but also anticipating their future actions based on behavior analysis and environmental context. Consider a robotic assistant in a hospital setting that not only identifies medical instruments but understands their purpose and application in various medical procedures. These are just some ways in which neurosymbolic AI could reshape industries like healthcare and transportation.</p><h2 id="""">Enhancements Through Object Permanence</h2><p id="""">An intriguing aspect of neurosymbolic AI efforts is the development of systems that can track objects beyond visual availability, akin to human infants' grasp of object permanence. By embedding symbolic reasoning in vision agents, we are enhancing their capabilities. This fusion allows these agents to make more informed judgments and undertake complex tasks efficiently.</p><h2 id="""">Insights into Human Cognition</h2><p id="""">While the advancement of neurosymbolic vision agents could drive technological progress, it might also advance our understanding of human cognition and perception. Much like studying artificial neural networks has contributed insights into the human brain, researching neurosymbolic vision agents might reveal principles of human vision and cognitive processes. Observing how these systems learn and reason could lead to groundbreaking discoveries in human cognitive development.</p><h2 id="""">The Future of Intelligent Agent AI</h2><p id="""">Although the integration of vision agents with neurosymbolic AI is still in its infancy, its potential is vast. Empowering AI systems with both seeing and understanding capabilities makes them not just smarter but also more capable of operating in complex environments. Moreover, this development could pave the way for uncovering new insights about how the human mind works, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and human-like AI systems.</p><h2 id="""">Conclusion</h2><p id="""">Neurosymbolic AI vision agents represent an exciting frontier in AI research. Their potential to revolutionize how AI perceives and understands the world is immense. As research progresses, these intelligent agent AI systems could significantly enhance various fields and offer fresh perspectives on human cognition.</p>","By integrating symbolic reasoning with visual capabilities, vision agents can move beyond mere image processing to actual comprehension.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/673b14cd0a14f7d1265335f5_Designer%20(69).webp,"A futuristic scene depicts a man with glasses and a digital, glowing blue cybernetic enhancement around one eye.

Anyone who's spent time in this field knows that automated testing can sometimes feel like wrestling an octopus—lots of arms, none of them pointing in the direction you want. But what if there was a more sensible, less tentacled way to approach it? Enter the new kid on the block: an innovative blend of AI and computer vision in web automation testing.</p><h2 id="""">A New Perspective on Automation</h2><p id="""">After experimenting with AI technologies at the university lab and engaging in many a caffeine-fueled late-night coding session, it hit us like a bolt of lightning (or maybe just a lack of sleep): there’s a better way to handle automation. Traditionally, automation relies heavily on code selectors, which can be as finicky as a cat on a hot tin roof. So why not let artificial intelligence do the heavy lifting?</p><p id="""">The breakthrough came by using screenshots to help a machine understand user interfaces the way humans do. Imagine giving your code the superpower of vision, allowing it to perceive elements like login buttons or text fields just as a human user would. No more tangling with code selectors; just good old-fashioned visual recognition. </p><h2 id="""">The Magic of Computer Vision in Web Testing</h2><p id="""">This approach uses modern computer vision technologies. Picture it: You, as a human, know what a login button looks like. Now, our AI does, too. Training AI to comprehend these visual cues allows for complete independence from pesky code selectors. It’s like teaching a robot to see—for lack of a better analogy, it’s a bit like Pinocchio becoming a real boy!</p><p id="""">But the beauty doesn't stop there. This visual wizardry applies to everything visible on the UI, including those annoying iframe shadow DOM or canvas elements. Anything your peepers can see, the AI can automate. We're talking web automation here that transcends browsers—it strolls into desktop applications and even traipses through native mobile apps. Your code now has eyes all over!</p><h2 id="""">UIs Built for Humans Become a Playground for AIs</h2><p id="""">User interfaces (UIs) are designed with humans in mind. Every button or text field is crafted to be as obvious as dad jokes at family dinners. This inherent stability makes them fertile ground for our computer vision-based approach. Because, let’s face it—if users struggle to find a button, our AI might too. But hey, if humans can't see it, then maybe it wasn’t meant to be visible?</p><p id="""">Our toolkits have already proven their mettle with web front ends and e-commerce sites, and the possibilities are as expansive as your imagination (or your browser history). We've pushed the boundaries further by automating tasks like scrolling through Google Maps or scripting sequences in 2D games. Picture this: AI trained on in-game text and assets, now coordinating a browser game without breaking a sweat. It's automation magic!</p><h2 id="""">The Future of Web Automation Testing</h2><p id="""">Picture this innovative approach like the Swiss Army knife of web automation testing. Whether you’re analyzing image elements on the screen or plotting relative positions for logistical efficiency, computer vision-powered AI is the future—a future where you're no longer BPM (Bored Per Minute) wrestling with selectors. Your code isn't just lines of text anymore; it's a visually aware, problem-solving partner in digital success.</p><p id="""">In conclusion, as web automation testing evolves, incorporating AI and computer vision transforms how we automate for the better. It creates an environment where everyone involved can see, quite literally, the solution without the hassle. So, here’s to a future where AI aids in making the web a little less mysterious and infinitely more efficient. Cheers to that!</p>","In the ever-evolving world of software development, one thing remains frustratingly consistent: testing is a bottleneck.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/66ffd2b703827de78f93ecfb_Designer%20(8).jpeg,"Two individuals are seated in front of a large computer displaying technical data, engaging in a testing process.

How does an AI go from just ""seeing"" pixels on a screen to actually understanding a user interface the same way you and I do?As the team at AskUI, our entire platform is built around this very concept. This isn't just a glossary definition for us. The fundamental engineering challenge which our team has worked on since the beginning remains our main focus.</p><p id="""">This guide breaks down the foundational concepts of an <strong id="""">intelligent vision AI agent</strong>. We will cover what it is, its core components, and why this approach is the only reliable way to solve modern automation challenges. We'll also share how this concept has evolved from a single agent into a powerful autonomous platform like our new <a href=""https://www.caesr.ai/"" id=""""><strong id=""""><code id="""">caesr.ai</code></strong></a>.</p><h3 id="""">The Problem and Why ""Blind"" Automation Fails</h3><p id="""">To understand what an intelligent vision agent <em id="""">is</em>, it's essential to first understand the problem it solves.</p><p id="""">For decades, traditional automation like Selenium or most RPA bots has operated like a ""blind"" robot. It relies on hidden ""locators"" in the application's code like an <code id="""">ID</code> or <code id="""">XPath</code> to find elements.</p><p id="""">The problem? The moment a developer updates the app and that <code id="""">ID</code> changes, even if the ""Submit"" button looks identical, the blind robot gets lost and the automation shatters. This is the root cause of flaky tests and endless maintenance.</p><h3 id="""">The Core Components of ""Intelligent Vision"" (The Original Definition)</h3><p id="""">An <strong id="""">intelligent vision AI agent</strong> operates on a completely different level. It's designed to mimic a sighted, human co-worker. Based on our experience building them, its ""intelligence"" is a combination of four key capabilities.</p><ol start=""1"" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Visual Perception (The ""Eyes"")</strong>This is the foundation. The agent uses advanced computer vision models, much like those in self-driving cars, to parse the screen into recognizable elements. It doesn't just see a cluster of blue pixels. Instead, it identifies a ""button,"" a ""text field,"" or an ""icon.""</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Contextual Understanding (The ""Brain"")</strong>This is the most critical part that separates it from simple OCR. The agent doesn't just <em id="""">see</em> a button. It <em id="""">understands</em> its purpose. It reads the text ""Log In"" and comprehends its function because it's located <em id="""">below</em> the ""Password"" field and <em id="""">part of</em> the main login form. This context is what allows it to make human-like decisions.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Reasoning and Planning (The ""Strategy"")</strong>Based on a given goal (e.g., ""Log into the application""), the agent can reason about the necessary steps. It identifies the required elements (""username"" and ""password"" fields), locates them visually, and plans the sequence of actions needed to achieve the goal.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Autonomous Action (The ""Hands"")</strong>Finally, the agent executes the plan by directly controlling the mouse and keyboard at the operating system level, just like a human would.</li></ol><p id="""">Because its understanding is visual and contextual, not code-based, the agent can <strong id="""">automatically adapt</strong> when the UI changes. If a button moves or its color changes, the agent can still find and interact with it, creating incredibly resilient automation.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/ai-test-automation-dynamic-ui"" id="""">Tired of Flaky Tests? Here’s How AI Test Automation Handles Dynamic UI Changes</a></p><h3 id="""">Our Experience: From Core Principles to a Real-World Solution</h3><p id="""">At AskUI, our core agent is the direct embodiment of these four principles. It's how we solve automation problems that are impossible for traditional tools.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Automating the ""Unautomatable"":</strong> This visual-first approach is the <em id="""">only</em> way to reliably automate technologies that don't expose their code, like <strong id="""">legacy desktop software</strong> or <strong id="""">virtual desktops (Citrix, VDI)</strong>. For a blind robot, these are black boxes.

They excel in scenarios where traditional frameworks fail due to a lack of stable selectors or access to the codebase.</p><ol start=""1"" id=""""><li><strong id="""">Automated UI &amp; E2E Testing</strong>For QA and DevOps leads, vision agents enable true black-box testing. They can interact with complex visual elements like charts, maps, or canvas-based graphics that have no accessible DOM elements. This is ideal for testing games, design software, or legacy desktop applications.</li><li><strong id="""">RPA &amp; Document Workflow Automation</strong>AI-first product teams use vision agents for next-generation Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

The Current State of Manual QA vs. AI Agent Testing Capabilities

The quality assurance landscape is experiencing a seismic shift that will fundamentally reshape how we approach software testing. Traditional manual QA processes, while serving the industry for decades, are increasingly showing their limitations in our fast-paced, digital-first world. Human testers, despite their expertise and intuition, are constrained by physical limitations that create bottlenecks in development cycles. Error rates in manual testing typically range from 15-25%, with fatigue and repetitive tasks contributing to missed bugs and inconsistent test execution. Time constraints further compound these challenges, as manual testers can only work within standard business hours and require significant time to execute comprehensive test suites.

In stark contrast, AI agent testing capabilities are revolutionizing the entire QA ecosystem. These intelligent systems operate continuously, executing tests 24/7 without breaks, sick days, or performance degradation due to fatigue. A single AI agent can simultaneously run thousands of test scenarios across multiple environments, browsers, and devices, achieving what would require an entire team of manual testers weeks to accomplish. The consistency factor alone represents a game-changing advantage, as AI agents execute identical test procedures every time, eliminating the variability inherent in human-performed testing.

Major technology companies are already reaping substantial benefits from AI agent implementation. Microsoft reported a 70% reduction in testing time and 40% improvement in bug detection rates after deploying AI agents across their Office 365 development pipeline. Netflix documented similar success, with their AI agent testing framework identifying critical performance issues 3x faster than their previous manual processes, directly contributing to improved user experience and reduced churn rates.

Leading AI agent testing platforms like Playwright AI, Testim, and Mabl are setting new industry standards with impressive performance metrics. Playwright AI demonstrates 95% test execution accuracy while reducing test creation time by 80%. Testim's self-healing capabilities automatically adapt to UI changes, maintaining test stability without manual intervention, while Mabl's intelligent test generation creates comprehensive test suites from user behavior patterns with minimal human oversight.

Key AI Agent Technologies Driving the QA Revolution

Machine learning algorithms form the backbone of modern AI agent testing capabilities, enabling systems to learn from previous test executions and continuously improve their effectiveness. These algorithms excel at intelligent test case generation, analyzing application behavior patterns to identify optimal test scenarios that human testers might overlook. Self-healing test scripts represent another breakthrough, automatically adjusting to minor UI changes, API modifications, or workflow alterations without requiring manual updates. This capability alone saves organizations hundreds of hours previously spent maintaining and updating test scripts.

Natural language processing has transformed how AI agents interact with testing requirements, allowing teams to describe test scenarios in plain English rather than complex technical scripts. Modern AI agents can interpret user stories, acceptance criteria, and business requirements, automatically generating comprehensive test suites that cover both happy path and edge case scenarios. This capability democratizes test creation, enabling product managers and business analysts to contribute directly to test coverage without deep technical expertise.

Computer vision AI agents are revolutionizing visual testing and user interface validation across the increasingly complex multi-device landscape. These systems can detect pixel-level differences, identify visual regressions, and verify UI consistency across thousands of device-browser combinations simultaneously. Unlike human testers who might miss subtle visual discrepancies, AI agents maintain consistent visual acuity, catching issues that could significantly impact user experience.

Predictive analytics capabilities allow AI agents to anticipate potential failure points by analyzing code changes, historical bug patterns, and system performance metrics. This proactive approach enables teams to address issues before they manifest in production, significantly reducing emergency fixes and customer-impacting incidents. AI agents can prioritize testing efforts based on risk assessment, focusing resources on areas most likely to contain defects.

The Economic and Strategic Drivers Accelerating AI Agent Adoption

The financial implications of transitioning to AI agent testing are compelling for organizations of all sizes. Comprehensive cost analyses reveal 60-80% reductions in overall QA expenses when companies migrate from manual testing to AI agent frameworks. These savings stem from reduced personnel costs, faster testing cycles, and decreased infrastructure requirements. While initial AI agent implementation requires upfront investment, most organizations achieve break-even within 12-18 months and realize substantial ongoing savings thereafter.

Time-to-market acceleration represents perhaps the most significant strategic advantage of AI agent testing. Organizations report reducing release cycles from weeks or months to days, enabling them to respond rapidly to market demands and competitive pressures. This agility directly translates to revenue impact, with faster feature delivery and bug resolution contributing to improved customer satisfaction and retention rates.

The talent acquisition crisis in manual QA creates additional urgency for AI agent adoption. Finding skilled manual testers has become increasingly challenging, with demand far outstripping supply in most technology markets. Experienced QA professionals command premium salaries, and high turnover rates further destabilize testing operations. AI agents eliminate these human resource challenges while providing more consistent and reliable testing capabilities.

Fortune 500 companies are documenting remarkable transformation journeys through AI agent implementation. Capital One reduced their regression testing time by 85% while improving defect detection rates by 45%. Spotify's AI agent testing framework enabled them to test their mobile applications across 2,000+ device configurations simultaneously, a feat impossible with manual testing approaches. These case studies demonstrate that AI agent testing is not just theoretical but delivering measurable business value today.

Preparing Your QA Team for the AI Agent Transition

The transition to AI agent testing does not necessarily mean eliminating QA teams but rather transforming their roles and responsibilities. Manual testers can evolve into AI agent managers, automation strategists, and quality architects who design, configure, and oversee AI agent operations. This evolution requires strategic upskilling initiatives that prepare team members for higher-value activities while leveraging AI agents for routine testing tasks.

Technical skill development must focus on areas that complement AI agent capabilities. Python and JavaScript proficiency becomes essential for configuring AI agent behaviors, customizing test scenarios, and integrating with existing development workflows. Understanding machine learning fundamentals helps QA professionals optimize AI agent performance and interpret testing results effectively. Test data management skills become crucial as AI agents require comprehensive, well-structured data sets to operate effectively.

Successful change management requires addressing team concerns proactively while demonstrating AI agent benefits through pilot projects and gradual implementation. Resistance often stems from fear of job displacement, but organizations that position AI agents as productivity enhancers rather than replacements achieve more successful transitions. Involving existing QA team members in AI agent selection, configuration, and optimization helps build buy-in and ensures institutional knowledge is preserved.

Certification programs from major cloud providers offer structured learning paths for AI agent testing capabilities. AWS offers specialized certifications in AI-powered testing services, while Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure provide comprehensive training programs covering machine learning applications in quality assurance. These credentials validate expertise and provide clear career progression paths for QA professionals embracing AI agent technologies.

Implementation success requires systematic planning and execution. A structured 90-day transition approach typically involves initial AI agent pilot projects, gradual expansion to additional testing scenarios, and eventual integration with continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines. This methodical approach minimizes risk while maximizing learning opportunities and ensuring smooth organizational adaptation to AI agent testing capabilities.

The Breaking Point - Why Traditional QA Teams Are Failing in 2025

The software development landscape has reached a critical juncture where traditional quality assurance methodologies are buckling under unprecedented pressure. Modern applications have evolved into complex, interconnected ecosystems spanning multiple platforms, microservices architectures, and diverse user interfaces that demand testing approaches far beyond what human-centric QA teams can reasonably handle.

The exponential growth in testing scenarios has become overwhelming. With DevOps practices accelerating release cycles and continuous integration pipelines demanding round-the-clock validation, traditional QA teams find themselves caught in an impossible race against time. Where development teams once released software monthly or quarterly, today's agile environments expect multiple deployments per day, each requiring comprehensive testing across numerous device configurations, browsers, and operating systems.

From a financial perspective, the mathematics are stark. Recent industry analysis reveals that traditional QA teams require 60-80% more resources to achieve the same test coverage that AI agent systems deliver automatically. This resource drain extends beyond immediate costs, encompassing training, benefits, workspace requirements, and the hidden expenses of human error remediation. Organizations maintaining conventional QA approaches are essentially paying premium prices for inferior outcomes.

Human limitations present fundamental bottlenecks that no amount of training or process improvement can overcome. Fatigue compromises attention to detail during lengthy testing sessions, while cognitive bias influences test case prioritization and bug severity assessments. Inconsistency between different testers creates gaps in coverage, and the inherent variability in human performance means that critical defects can slip through even the most rigorous manual processes.

A compelling case study from a Fortune 500 enterprise illustrates this transformation dramatically. After migrating from traditional QA to AI agent systems, the organization documented a 400% improvement in testing efficiency while simultaneously reducing their quality assurance budget by more than half. The AI agent implementation identified 300% more critical bugs during pre-release testing compared to their previous human-led approach, preventing costly post-deployment fixes and customer-facing incidents.

How AI Agents Are Revolutionizing Quality Assurance

AI agents represent a paradigm shift in quality assurance, leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms to transform reactive testing into predictive quality management. These intelligent systems analyze code patterns, user behavior data, and historical defect information to generate comprehensive test scenarios that human testers might never consider. The predictive capabilities enable proactive identification of potential failure points before they manifest as actual bugs.

The 24/7 operational capacity of AI agents eliminates the constraints of human work schedules and geographic limitations. While traditional QA teams operate within business hours and require coordination across time zones, AI agent systems continuously monitor application performance, execute test suites, and provide real-time reporting without interruption. This constant vigilance means critical issues are detected and reported immediately, rather than waiting for the next business day or testing cycle.

Natural language processing capabilities have democratized test creation, allowing product managers, business analysts, and even end-users to describe testing scenarios in plain English. AI agents interpret these conversational inputs and automatically generate executable test cases, eliminating the technical barrier that previously required specialized QA expertise. This accessibility dramatically expands the testing perspective beyond traditional QA team boundaries.

Self-healing automation represents perhaps the most revolutionary advancement in AI agent technology. When user interface changes occur, traditional automated tests typically break and require manual intervention to update test scripts. AI agents, however, can recognize interface modifications and adapt their testing approach automatically, maintaining test coverage even as applications evolve. This self-maintenance capability ensures consistent testing quality without the constant human oversight that plagues conventional automation frameworks.

Integration with existing development workflows occurs seamlessly through APIs and webhook connections that plug directly into popular CI/CD platforms. AI agents receive notifications of code commits, automatically execute relevant test suites, and provide detailed feedback within the development team's existing tools. This tight integration means testing becomes an invisible, automatic component of the development process rather than a separate, time-consuming phase.

Implementation Roadmap - Transitioning to AI Agent-Powered QA

Phase 1 focuses on comprehensive assessment and strategic tool selection. Organizations must evaluate their current testing infrastructure, identify specific pain points, and establish clear success criteria for AI agent implementation. The selection process should prioritize platforms that offer robust integration capabilities with existing development tools, comprehensive reporting features, and scalability to accommodate future growth. Key evaluation criteria include learning curve requirements, customization flexibility, and vendor support quality.

Phase 2 introduces controlled pilot programs designed to demonstrate AI agent value while minimizing organizational disruption. Successful pilots target specific application components or testing scenarios where traditional methods have consistently struggled. Establishing measurable KPIs such as test execution speed, defect detection rates, and resource utilization provides concrete evidence of improvement. Automation enthusiasts within the organization should lead these pilots, leveraging their technical expertise and change advocacy to build internal momentum.

Phase 3 addresses the human element through comprehensive training and change management strategies. While AI agents reduce the need for manual testing, they require new skills in test strategy, AI system management, and result interpretation. Training programs should emphasize the elevated role of QA professionals as AI supervisors and quality architects rather than manual test executors. Change management efforts must address concerns about job displacement while highlighting opportunities for career advancement in AI-augmented quality assurance.

Phase 4 culminates in full-scale deployment with continuous optimization protocols. This phase requires careful monitoring of performance metrics, regular AI model tuning, and iterative improvement of test coverage strategies. Success depends on establishing feedback loops that capture user experience data and incorporate it into AI agent learning processes. Organizations should expect a 3-6 month optimization period as AI agents adapt to specific application behaviors and business requirements.

Common implementation challenges include resistance from existing QA teams, integration complexity with legacy systems, and initial AI model training requirements. Expert-backed solutions emphasize transparent communication about role evolution, phased integration approaches that respect existing investments, and partnerships with experienced AI agent vendors who provide comprehensive implementation support.

ROI Analysis and Future Predictions for AI Agent QA

The financial impact of AI agent implementation delivers measurable returns that justify investment within the first fiscal year. Industry data demonstrates an average 65% reduction in QA costs within 12 months, driven primarily by reduced personnel requirements and eliminated manual testing redundancies. These savings compound over time as AI agents require minimal ongoing maintenance compared to the continuous training and management overhead of human QA teams.

Performance improvements extend far beyond cost savings, fundamentally transforming quality assurance effectiveness. AI agents execute test suites 85% faster than human-led processes while achieving 92% improvement in bug detection accuracy. This enhanced performance directly translates to reduced customer-facing defects, improved user satisfaction scores, and decreased post-deployment maintenance costs.

Emerging trends indicate that AI agents are rapidly incorporating generative AI capabilities to create comprehensive test data sets and realistic user scenarios. These advanced systems can simulate diverse user personas, generate edge-case testing scenarios, and create synthetic data that covers testing requirements impossible to achieve through traditional methods. The combination of testing execution and test case generation within a single AI agent platform represents the next evolution in autonomous quality assurance.

Predictions for 2025-2027 suggest integration with quantum computing capabilities that will enable AI agents to process exponentially more complex testing scenarios simultaneously. Advanced AI reasoning capabilities will allow these systems to understand application intent and business logic, moving beyond mechanical test execution toward intelligent quality validation that considers user experience and business impact.

Industry research from leading technology analysts consistently supports the trajectory toward AI agent dominance in quality assurance. Organizations that delay this transition risk competitive disadvantage as their competitors achieve faster time-to-market, higher quality products, and more efficient resource utilization. The question for tech enthusiasts is not whether AI agents will replace traditional QA approaches, but how quickly they can position their organizations to capitalize on this inevitable transformation.

These limitations force constant human intervention, creating operational bottlenecks that prevent organizations from achieving true efficiency at scale. From customer service workflows that break down with unexpected queries to supply chain systems that cannot adapt to sudden market shifts, traditional automation is showing its age in an increasingly unpredictable business environment.<br><br>This comprehensive guide will equip you with everything needed to navigate this pivotal transition. You'll discover the fundamental differences between agentic AI and traditional automation, explore compelling business cases backed by real ROI data from early adopters, and gain practical implementation strategies that can be applied immediately. Most importantly, you'll learn how to future-proof your automation career by developing the essential skills needed to thrive in an AI-driven landscape. Whether you're an automation professional, technology decision-maker, or simply someone passionate about the future of intelligent systems, this article provides the strategic insights and actionable roadmap you need to stay ahead of the curve in 2025.<br><br>---<br><br>Understanding Agentic AI vs. Traditional Automation Systems<br><br>The automation landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, and at the center of this revolution lies agentic AI - a paradigm shift that promises to redefine how we think about intelligent systems. Unlike traditional automation that relies on predetermined rules and rigid workflows, agentic AI represents a new breed of autonomous systems capable of independent decision-making, adaptive learning, and contextual problem-solving without constant human intervention.<br><br>To understand the magnitude of this shift, consider how traditional automation has served us for decades. These systems operate through explicit programming - if-then statements, predefined triggers, and static decision trees that execute tasks exactly as programmed. While effective for repetitive, predictable processes, traditional automation hits a wall when faced with unexpected scenarios or nuanced decision-making requirements. Think of a manufacturing robot that stops production when it encounters a slightly different component size, or a customer service chatbot that can only respond with scripted answers regardless of the complexity of the inquiry.<br><br>Agentic AI breaks free from these constraints by leveraging advanced machine learning models, neural networks, and sophisticated reasoning capabilities. These systems can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, learn from new situations, adapt their responses based on context, and even anticipate problems before they occur. The technical architecture fundamentally differs from traditional automation - instead of static scripts and rule engines, agentic AI employs dynamic neural networks that continuously evolve and improve their performance.<br><br>Real-world implementations are already demonstrating this superiority across multiple industries. In customer service, agentic AI systems are handling complex multi-turn conversations, understanding customer intent beyond keywords, and providing personalized solutions that would previously require human intervention. Supply chain management has seen agentic AI predict and mitigate disruptions by analyzing weather patterns, geopolitical events, and supplier behavior simultaneously. Manufacturing environments are witnessing AI agents that optimize production schedules in real-time, adjusting for equipment performance, material availability, and quality metrics without human oversight.<br><br>The Business Case for Agentic AI Adoption in 2025<br><br>The financial implications of transitioning to agentic AI are compelling, with early adopters reporting transformational results that extend far beyond simple cost savings. Industry research and real-world case studies consistently demonstrate that organizations implementing agentic AI solutions are achieving efficiency gains of up to 40% while simultaneously reducing operational costs and improving service quality.<br><br>Consider the experience of a major logistics company that replaced their traditional rule-based routing system with an agentic AI solution. Within six months, they reported a 35% reduction in delivery times, 28% lower fuel costs, and a 50% decrease in customer complaints related to delayed shipments. The AI agent continuously learned from traffic patterns, weather conditions, driver performance, and customer preferences to optimize routes in ways that static algorithms never could.<br><br>The competitive advantages extend beyond operational metrics. Companies leveraging agentic AI are achieving faster time-to-market for new products and services because their systems can adapt to changing requirements without extensive reprogramming. Customer experience improvements are particularly notable, with AI agents providing personalized, contextual interactions that feel more natural and helpful than traditional automated responses.<br><br>Scalability represents another crucial business advantage. Traditional automation systems require linear scaling - more processes typically mean more rules, more maintenance, and more complexity. Agentic AI systems, conversely, become more intelligent and efficient as they handle more data and scenarios. They learn from every interaction, continuously improving their performance without additional programming overhead.<br><br>While implementation costs for agentic AI may appear higher initially, the long-term value proposition is undeniable. Organizations are finding that the reduced maintenance costs, improved accuracy rates, and enhanced capability to handle complex scenarios result in positive ROI within 12-18 months. More importantly, these systems future-proof businesses against evolving market demands and competitive pressures that static automation cannot address.<br><br>Technical Implementation and Integration Strategies<br><br>Transitioning from traditional automation to agentic AI requires careful planning and a systematic approach that minimizes disruption while maximizing the benefits of advanced AI capabilities. The migration process should begin with a comprehensive assessment of existing automation infrastructure, identifying which processes are best suited for immediate AI enhancement and which may require gradual transition.<br><br>The first step involves evaluating your current automation landscape and mapping out dependencies, data flows, and integration points. Many organizations discover that their existing automation tools can serve as valuable data sources and execution endpoints for agentic AI systems, rather than complete replacements. This hybrid approach allows for gradual transition while maintaining operational continuity.<br><br>Infrastructure requirements for agentic AI differ significantly from traditional automation. These systems require robust computing resources capable of handling machine learning workloads, high-quality data pipelines for continuous learning, and secure communication channels for real-time decision-making. Cloud-based solutions often provide the most flexible and cost-effective approach, offering scalable computing resources and pre-built AI services that can accelerate implementation.<br><br>Key technologies underlying agentic AI include natural language processing for understanding and generating human-like communications, computer vision for analyzing visual data and environments, and reinforcement learning algorithms that enable systems to improve through experience. Understanding these components helps in selecting appropriate tools and platforms for specific use cases.<br><br>Successful implementations typically follow a phased approach, beginning with pilot programs in controlled environments where the impact of errors is minimal. These pilots serve as proof of concept while generating valuable data about system performance, user acceptance, and integration challenges. Gradually expanding the scope allows organizations to build confidence and expertise while refining their implementation strategies.<br><br>Integration with existing systems requires careful attention to data formats, communication protocols, and security requirements. Modern agentic AI platforms typically offer extensive APIs and integration capabilities, but planning for data transformation, error handling, and fallback procedures is essential for robust deployment.<br><br>Future-Proofing Your Automation Career and Skills<br><br>The rise of agentic AI presents unprecedented opportunities for automation professionals willing to evolve their skill sets and embrace new technologies. Rather than replacing human expertise, agentic AI augments human capabilities and creates new roles that bridge the gap between traditional automation and intelligent AI systems.<br><br>Prompt engineering has emerged as one of the most critical skills for automation professionals transitioning to agentic AI. This discipline involves crafting effective instructions and queries that enable AI systems to understand context, constraints, and desired outcomes. Unlike traditional programming where instructions must be explicit and comprehensive, prompt engineering requires understanding how AI models process language and how to communicate complex requirements in natural language format.<br><br>AI model training and fine-tuning represent another essential competency area. Automation professionals need to understand how to prepare training data, select appropriate model architectures, and optimize performance for specific use cases. This doesn't require becoming a machine learning researcher, but rather developing practical skills in model configuration, data preparation, and performance evaluation.<br><br>Human-AI collaboration skills are becoming increasingly valuable as organizations deploy agentic AI systems alongside human workers. This includes understanding how to design workflows that leverage both human intuition and AI capabilities, establishing appropriate oversight and intervention protocols, and creating feedback loops that help AI systems learn from human expertise.<br><br>Several certification programs and training resources have emerged to support this transition. Major cloud providers offer specialized tracks in AI automation, while professional organizations are developing certification standards for agentic AI implementation and management. Online learning platforms provide practical courses in prompt engineering, AI model deployment, and automation design for AI systems.<br><br>Emerging job roles in the agentic AI automation landscape include AI automation architects who design intelligent workflows, AI training specialists who optimize model performance for specific applications, and human-AI collaboration managers who ensure effective integration between autonomous systems and human workers. These roles typically offer higher compensation and greater career growth potential than traditional automation positions.<br><br>Career transition strategies should focus on building practical experience through hands-on projects, staying current with rapidly evolving AI technologies, and developing a portfolio that demonstrates expertise in both traditional automation and agentic AI implementation. The key is to view agentic AI not as a replacement for existing skills, but as an evolution that amplifies the value of automation expertise while opening new possibilities for innovation and career growth.<br><br>---<br><br>As we stand at the threshold of 2025, the transformation from traditional automation to agentic AI represents more than just a technological upgrade—it's a fundamental shift toward truly intelligent systems that can think, adapt, and evolve. Throughout this exploration, we've seen how agentic AI transcends the rigid limitations of rule-based automation, offering unprecedented capabilities in autonomous decision-making, contextual understanding, and adaptive learning that traditional systems simply cannot match.

Here are a two example prompts and their outputs:</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'>-- CODE language-ts line-numbers --
// Example 1
await aui.ask(""Please list the social media searches."");

Some common examples are:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Notification counters</li><li id="""">Numbers on the side of labels or icons</li><li id="""">Getting the status of an element</li></ul><p id="""">Let us do a simple example. When we want to check if the <code id="""">Widgets</code> element in the sidebar has a <code id="""">NEW</code> tag we can do exactly that:</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'>-- CODE language-ts line-numbers --

For example, if you want to extract the users from the table at the bottom <strong id="""">and</strong> only want the <code id="""">username</code> and the <code id="""">usage</code> columns, you can write an instruction like this:</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'>-- CODE language-ts line-numbers --
