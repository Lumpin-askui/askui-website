  "challenge": "FICUS Health supports rehabilitation clinics with AI-powered documentation. Yet every clinic still relied on legacy hospital information systems that required manual copying of physician notes and discharge documentation. Care teams spent hours retyping structured reports into the hospital software, updates were delayed, and incomplete entries risked reimbursement penalties.",
  "solution": "FICUS Health partnered with AskUI to automate the hand-off between its platform and hospital systems. AskUI Vision Agents read the existing UI, trigger the correct workflows, and write back structured documentation without APIs. The integration now pushes discharge reports, peer-review checkpoints, and billing codes directly into each clinic's on-premise software, while providing an audit trail for compliance.",
  "results": [
    "70% reduction in documentation time per patient episode",
    "0 manual copy-and-paste steps required for discharge reports",
    "Consistent DRV-compliant documentation across all clinics",
    "Real-time updates inside legacy hospital software",
    "Clinical teams gain 12 extra hours per week for patient care",
    "Implementation completed without changes to existing IT"

  "content": "## The Challenge\n\nFICUS Health delivers AI tools that draft discharge reports, extract information from medical records, and support peer review. Clinics loved the accuracy but still needed staff to move data into their legacy hospital information systems (KIS). Manual copy-and-paste consumed hours per patient, introduced errors, and delayed reimbursement-critical documentation.\n\n## Why AskUI\n\nThe team needed a UI-level automation layer that could:\n\n- Work across a fragmented estate of on-premise hospital systems\n- Respect strict data protection rules with no additional agents installed\n- Handle both German-language interfaces and bespoke shortcuts\n- Provide an auditable trail of exactly what was written back\n\nAskUI's Vision Agents recognized every UI element visually, performed human-like interactions, and required no APIs or code changes inside the hospital software.\n\n## Implementation\n\nWithin six weeks, FICUS configured AskUI flows that:\n\n1. Launch the appropriate clinic application for a patient episode\n2. Navigate to the discharge module using keystrokes and visual anchors\n3. Paste structured documentation generated by FICUS Scribe and Doc Extract\n4. Verify fields against DRV rules using AskUI assertions\n\n## Results\n\n- **70% faster documentation cycles** with zero manual re-entry\n- **Consistent DRV-compliant reports** delivered directly to the hospital system\n- **12 hours of clinical time reclaimed weekly** at the pilot site\n- **Automated peer-review reminders** triggered inside the legacy workflow\n\n## What's Next\n\nFICUS Health is extending the AskUI integration to additional clinics and exploring automated imports of historical cases. The company now treats AskUI as a standard module in every new deployment, ensuring customers receive end-to-end automation from consultation to discharge.",
