  "content": "<p id=\">Through the current times, web and mobile app testing are more in demand as compared to testing for desktop apps. Nonetheless, testing desktop apps becomes reasonably important when in complex enterprise environments, the developers work over sophisticated legacy systems. </p><p id=\">Desktop applications need installation and configuration, followed by execution on a desktop OS, which could be macOS, Linux, or Windows. Hence, for desktop applications to be operational, end-users need to use a PC or a laptop that features sufficient hardware resources.</p><p id=\">The technologies most frequently used to build desktop applications include Java (JavaFX, SWT, AWT, and Swing), .NET (VB.NET, WinForms, WPF, and UWP), GDI, Visual Basic, MFC, Visual C++, SAPGUI, PowerBuilder, Oracle Forms, DevExpress, Telerik, Infragistics, Cocoa, and Xlib.</p><p id=\">In this article, we will go through a list of the finest Automation tools that automate the desktop app’s functional testing.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">1. WinAppDriver</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">It is over the WebDriver protocol that WinAppDriver has been built. For mobile and web app testing, it is the gold standard. WinAppDriver is ideal for driving any Windows app. They include classic Windows controls (Win32), WinForms, WPF, and UWP. These Windows apps may be using a range of language bindings such as C#, Python, Java, or Ruby, or test runners such as MSTest, Nunit, or JUnit, etc.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">2. Winium</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">For WPF and WinForms app testing, Winium is an open-source Test Automation framework. Just as in the case of WinAppDriver, Winium is also based on the WebDriver protocol. But upon comparison, Winium may not be able to match up with WinAppDriver in several areas. Since 2016, Winium has not been maintained actively, so a tester has to add improvements or fix bugs by themself.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">3. TestArchitect</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">With TestArchitect being a testing tool driven by keywords, even a tester whose programming skills are modest can learn using the tool quickly. The tool makes an extensive keyword library available. Furthermore, the TechArchitect features Action-based testing, a modern testing method driven by keywords. Across recent years, TechArchitect has appeared in Forrester Research reports as well. The depth and width of support and high usability offered by TechArchitect make it relatively stronger as compared to open source solutions.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">4. Ranorex</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">As a test automation tool, Ranorex has been in the market for a long time. Anorex offers proprietary Automation technologies that aid with the automation of mobile apps, web apps, and desktop apps. In particular, in the Japanese markets, Ranorex enjoys a strong presence, because of their reliable record &amp; playback, and Japanese localization.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">5. Tricentis Tosca</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">In the case of Tricentis Tosca, wide support is made available for virtually all test activities. Tosca offers a Continuous Testing platform for the customers. This covers test data management, service virtualization, API testing, UI testing, and test design. Tosca has recently acquired QASymphony (qTest). Here, they further expanded their scope to test management. In particular, the manual testers who intend to transition to automation testing engineers should be using Tosca.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">6. SmartBear TestComplete</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">SmartBear TestComplete has been in the automation market since 1999. This makes SmartBear one of the veterans. In the case of TestComplete (TC), one accesses a comprehensive solution covering mobile, web, and desktop. TC has also recently added a hybrid UI matching method that combines object recognition and visual recognition. The testing method of TC is keyword-driven, and even the non-technical testers can use it.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">7. Micro Focus UFT (formerly HP QTP)</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">UFT/QTP is a unique suite of testing tools for being the oldest tools to still survive in the automation market. As a powerful UI testing tool, UFT makes it easier for you to test an elaborate range of platforms, including mobile, SAP, web services, web, and desktop. Furthermore, UFT/QTP seamlessly integrates with HP Quality Center. In a single flow, one can run end-to-end cross-platform tests jumping from API to desktop, mobile, and web.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">8. SikuliX</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">As an open-source tool, SkiuliX uses OCR and image recognition to automate all things visible on the screen. Nevertheless, the default use case of SikuliX is small projects since it has been designed for automating mundane tasks on Windows. Still, upon scaling up, you’d come across unsolvable problems. These problems occur because of the nature of image recognition techniques. In essence, image recognition is slower than object recognition.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">9. AskUI</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">AskUI simulates the actions of a human tester and can find any UI element visible on your operating system. This enables the automation of cross-platform and canvas based application, that are untestable with common selector-based tools. It works out-of-the box by recognizing objects on an UI level.</p><p id=\">If you are unsure where to start, you can <a href=\"http://app.askui.com/selfserve-signup-form\" id=\">start building with AskUI for free</a>.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">10. Robot Framework</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">Another one of the open-source tools driven by keywords is the Robot Framework. Robot’s flexibility is highlighted by the fact that it can be used with numerous desktop Automation libraries, including SwingLibrary (Java Swing GUI), SapGuiLibrary, SikuliLibrary (SikuliX), AutoItLibrary (AutoIt), and EclipseLibrary (Eclipse RCP/SWT).</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">High levels of competition characterize Automation Testing’s tool market through the current times, and a developer should be discretionary in choosing the best-suited automation testing tools for desktop apps. This should vary by the use case.</p>",
