## Hello, I am Johannes Dienst and welcome to J&J Talk AI.
With me is Johannes Haux.

JD:**And today we are talking about computer vision, but this is the first episode and we have to talk about a brief origin story about artificial intelligence. So Johannes, what is artificial intelligence?

JH:**That's a really good question, especially since it's a name that's being thrown around quite a lot these days, right? Every company is doing stuff with AI now.

And yeah, so the idea that we that there could be some kind of machine-like being that is not a human, but similarly intelligent or even more intelligent, whatever that might mean, that's something that's been around for ages. And in the 1960s, I think that's when there was the last AI explosion, so to say, before there was kind of an AI winter, I think it's called, where people said, hey, now we have computers, right? We have machines, we can do stuff, we can train them or program them to do everything we humans can do, for example, also using computer vision.
And then we quite quickly realized that that is not necessarily the case.

******I personally dislike this term, if I'm being honest, because it implies some intelligence. For me, it's more like machine learning and there's also deep learning and then there's artificial intelligence. And I think a lot of people throw these terms around. I think there's a difference between that, between machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Maybe you can lay out what you see as a difference there.

JH:**Yeah, I'll try to do that.

So I find algorithms that somehow figure out what the optimal programming of this machine is and that's called learning because it's an iterative process. I have examples usually, which I can show the machine to say, hey, look, given this input, this should be the output. And then using algorithms of various sorts, I can then teach this program how to behave. So that's machine learning.

So deep learning is a subset of all the techniques that you can call machine learning. And deep learning is also often associated with the name artificial intelligence.

But to be honest, if you look at products that say, hey, we have artificial intelligence in it, it's usually just fancy algorithms and not real intelligence. And I'm saying that without even knowing what real intelligence is, right? So that's the main criticism of this name, I think. So it's more of a marketing term in my eyes and less of a specific specification, so to say, of what we're talking about.

Because those are usually or nowadays called something like the spark of AI, I think is the name that's been thrown around, or the spark of artificial general intelligence, which is questionable, to put it in friendly terms. So if you want to learn about what artificial intelligence is and what not, I would recommend you check out her work too.

JD:**We will link it in the show notes, of course. I know this paper, but I did not read it.

**I think it was even used, but again, don't quote me on this, in, I think, therapy for lonely people, because they could talk about their fears and their thoughts with somebody who would respond and would keep the conversation going without any form of intelligence lying underneath it.

**And somebody famous, I won't name here, talked about, yeah, chatGPT is so far ahead. It already seems like sentient AI. What brings us to the term when I studied it was like artificial general intelligence, or if you take the acronym, it's AGI.
What is AGI?

The way I would interpret it, or I think the way it's generally interpreted is a system that can solve any task like a human would or better, like better than a human would, you know, whatever inputs we would, for example, expect ourselves like a command or some image or I don't know, a thought, whatever.

****The scientific process and again, I'm quoting this podcast from Adam Conover and with Timnit Gebru and another colleague of hers. They say that research is a process of exploration without necessarily knowing where we'll end up. The scientific process is I have a hypothesis and now I test it and see where it takes me. And this notion of we are getting to a point where this artificial intelligence will spawn other intelligences and so on to at some point surpass us. That basically is just an extrapolation of where we are right now from where we've been a few years ago.

So I would be very careful about these kinds of predictions and definitions of what AGI is because I don't know where we will be in five years, ten years from now. Definitely the way there will be very, very interesting and we'll potentially find very amazing discoveries on the way. But I don't know if we'll find a system that will replicate and start the singularity. Let's find out.

JD:**Perfect last words for the first episode.
