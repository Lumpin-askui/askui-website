### “Vibe coding” is more than a passing trend it’s become a defining movement in tech.
Vibe coders skip heavy specs and perfect architectures, diving straight into building. They thrive on quick sprints, launch MVPs in days, and learn by putting real products in front of real users.

But Moving Fast Comes with Risks

FAQ

Will this slow down my deploy cycles?**
Not at all. It runs alongside your existing tools, validating flows automatically so you keep your speed without waiting on manual sign-offs.

Can it replace manual testers entirely?**
No, and that’s not the goal. It dramatically reduces repetitive checks and flags critical issues early, freeing human QA to focus on complex edge cases and overall experience.

Is it only for large engineering teams?**
No. Whether you’re a solo indie maker or part of a big org, our chatbot will have flexible options to match your scale and needs.
