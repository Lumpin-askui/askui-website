**Memory plays a crucial role in an LLM agent's ability to learn and adapt. LLM agents retain information from their past interactions, enabling them to build upon previous experiences and refine their approach over time. This stored memory might include past conversations with users, previously generated solutions, or even intermediate steps taken during problem-solving. By accessing and leveraging this wealth of information, LLM agents can provide more personalized, efficient, and contextually relevant responses.
