## Why Are QA Teams Struggling With Modern UI Complexity?

Many QA teams find themselves under pressure, working with applications that are increasingly complex, fragmented, and quick to evolve.

Traditional automated scripts often fail, and even robust model-based testing (MBT) approaches have trouble keeping up with unpredictable user interfaces and frequent updates.

This article explains how **Agentic AI** complements MBT, helping QA teams sustain coverage, speed up releases, and reduce the hassle of constant test maintenance.

## What Is Model-Based Testing (MBT), and Why Is It Important?

**Model-Based Testing (MBT)** is a software quality approach where abstract models (like state diagrams or workflows) define expected system behaviors. Automated tools then generate test cases from these models.

**Advantages:**

- Broad, systematic scenario coverage
- Easy updates: change the model, regenerate tests
- Faster test creation for complex systems

**Challenges:**

- Needs skilled modeling effort
- Can't adapt to unexpected UI shifts
- Often requires frequent updates when UIs change

## How Does Agentic AI Strengthen MBT?

Agentic AI uses goal-driven, autonomous agents that visually interpret UIs and adapt in real time. Unlike static scripts or rigid models, these agents explore based on objectives.

**Why it matters:**

- **Dynamic exploration:** Learns new UI paths automatically
- **Adaptive recovery:** When UI elements move or change, still completes tasks
- **Rapid discovery:** Finds edge cases MBT models may miss

Together, Agentic AI and MBT give QA teams both broad, model-driven validation and real-world flexibility.

## Where Do Agentic AI and MBT Work Best Together?

| Testing Focus | MBT Strengths | Agentic AI Advantages |
|---|---|---|
| **Coverage strategy** | Systematic, model-based | Adaptive, UI-driven exploration |
| **UI change tolerance** | Needs model rework | Adjusts dynamically on its own |
| **Use cases** | Business logic, compliance flows | Dynamic layouts, personalization |
| **Best together for** | Stable flows + edge-case discovery | Full-spectrum QA |

Pairing these approaches ensures both predictable coverage and resilience to rapid UI evolution.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Retail apps:** MBT validates checkout and account workflows; Agentic AI tests promotions and UI experiments
- **Banking systems:** MBT covers transaction paths; Agentic AI explores device-specific UI rendering
- **Healthcare portals:** MBT ensures regulated patient flows; Agentic AI handles third-party UI embeds

## What Should QA Leaders Plan For?

✅ **Skills:** Teams must understand both abstract modeling and AI agent configuration.

✅ **Toolchain:** Choose platforms that blend MBT with agentic exploration.

✅ **Metrics:** Track new KPIs like autonomous exploration coverage alongside pass/fail rates.
