Types of Test Automation Using Machine Learning
Automated User Interface Testing (UI)

Machine Learning helps developers spend more time writing code and less time creating and running unit tests. The creation and maintenance of AI-based unit test scripts are also useful at the end of the product life cycle.
API Testing

Any update, upgrade, or code change will require altering the test scripts; therefore, you must qualify several test scripts. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools can predict whether a test application will need multiple tests. As a result, you avoid wasting your time and money on unproductive test cases.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning-based test data generation

RPA automates existing IT systems while maintaining them simultaneously. A scan of the screen, navigation of the systems, and identification and collection of data occur. Through web and mobile applications, all tasks are automated and run through robots. In addition, its main advantages are scalability, cost savings, improved productivity, codeless testing, and accurate output.

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are just scratching the surface for test automation. These technologies are still in development and have huge potential that could significantly enhance current test automation. There are lots of applications and opportunities that Machine Learning in test automation can provide in the future for IT enterprises, and here are some of them:
Test automation will become the standard with Machine Learning, ultimately replacing manual testing. Despite this, companies will adopt a culture of frequent testing using test automation.

- An AI-based test generation tool will solve the issue of too many or too few test cases. The intelligent tools will probably make life easier for testers and coders, whether they are testing UIs or APIs.

- Combining test automation and Machine Learning will save time and money now and in the future, encouraging companies to use this duo across all departments of their company.
