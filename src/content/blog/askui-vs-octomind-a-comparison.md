## What Are AskUI and Octomind?

**AskUI** is an AI-powered automation tool that visually interacts with desktop, web, mobile, and canvas applications. It enables non-technical users to create automations using natural language.

**Octomind** is an AI-driven end-to-end web testing platform that automatically generates, executes, and debugs test cases, ideal for fast and scalable QA cycles.

## How Does AskUI Work?

AskUI uses AI-powered computer vision and natural language processing to automate UI actions. Users describe desired actions in plain language (via Prompt-to-Action), and AskUI converts them into executable workflows.

- Supports cross-platform testing: desktop, web, Android, and canvas.
- Compatible with MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Android.
- Offers local, cloud, and hybrid deployment.
- Integrates with Zapier, Jenkins, Docker, and n8n.

## How Does Octomind Work?

Octomind focuses exclusively on web application testing. It uses AI agents to automatically:

1. Analyze web app structure
2. Generate test scenarios
3. Execute tests in parallel
4. Debug failing cases

Its cloud-based infrastructure allows fast test cycles and seamless CI/CD integration.

- No test scripting required
- Parallel test execution (within 20 minutes)
- Programmatic and scheduled runs

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

| Feature | AskUI | Octomind |
