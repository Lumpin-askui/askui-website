TypeScript/JavaScript SDK is no longer the primary method within AskUI. It is now the previous generation**. We strongly recommend**Python SDK which is AskUI's primary language**to leverage the full power of the Caesr.ai AI Agent platform. Stop writing unnecessary control flow functions and start telling the AI what you need.

### In the previous generation automation environment achieving code reusability for conditional actions, like checking if an element is present and reacting to it, required writing custom utility functions. This approach created significant code maintenance overhead as developers were constantly writing repetitive logic.

### With **Caesr.AI**interface. This eliminates the need for coding, function definition, or maintenance.

## Role of the Python SDK

Caesr.AI**is the primary**the Python SDK remains the recommended method for developers**. It acts as the powerful entry point for advanced users who require deeper integration. This includes setting up the test execution environment or integrating AI workflows into CI/CD pipelines.

[Conclusion

natural language automation**to create robust, reusable, and self-maintaining workflows, freeing your team from code maintenance.
