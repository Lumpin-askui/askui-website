## What's the Difference Between AskUI and Adept?

**AskUI and Adept both offer AI-driven automation, but they target different needs.** AskUI excels in visual UI interaction and natural language-based action prompts. Adept focuses on building autonomous agents for complex enterprise workflows.

Below is a side-by-side comparison to help QA managers, engineers, and automation leads decide which fits their environment best.

## What Is AskUI and How Does It Work?

**AskUI is a prompt-driven UI automation platform powered by computer vision.**

It simulates human interactions by visually identifying and interacting with UI elements—across desktop, mobile, canvas, and web—without relying on fragile element selectors.

### Key Features of AskUI

- **Prompt-to-Action (PTA):** Users describe actions in plain English. AskUI translates them into executable UI interactions.
- **Visual Recognition:** Automates any visible interface—buttons, text, or graphics—just like a human tester would.
- **Pre-trained & Custom AI Models:** Preloaded with UIDT and PTA models, which can be fine-tuned for specific workflows.
- **Platform Flexibility:** Works on macOS, Windows, Android, and Linux.
- **Deployment Options:** Local, hybrid, or cloud-based automation.
- **Tool Integrations:** Compatible with Zapier, n8n, Jenkins, and Docker.

✅ **Best For:**
QA teams looking for visual-first automation, cross-platform support, and low-code setup.

## What Is Adept AI Agent Automation?

**Adept builds full-stack AI agents that automate complex tasks across enterprise software.**

Its agents combine proprietary multimodal models with task-specific actuation systems to perform end-to-end workflows.

### Key Features of Adept

- **Enterprise AI Agents:** Designed to handle multistep, multi-app workflows across enterprise systems.
- **Multimodal Understanding:** Processes text, charts, tables, and documents to make intelligent decisions.
- **Fast Setup with NLP Prompts:** New workflows can be initiated using natural language, often in minutes.
- **High Accuracy & Resilience:** Agents adapt to UI changes and minimize maintenance needs.
- **Planning & Execution Engine:** Adept claims superior planning performance over models like GPT-4 in enterprise contexts.

✅ **Best For:**
Organizations needing intelligent agents that can manage entire workflows across multiple enterprise tools.

## AskUI vs. Adept: Feature Comparison

| Feature | AskUI | Adept |
|---|---|---|
| Automation Type | Visual UI Interaction | Enterprise Workflow Agents |
| Input Method | Prompt-to-Action (Natural Language) | Natural Language Prompts |
| Core Strength | AI vision-based interaction | End-to-end workflow execution |
| Platform Support | Windows, macOS, Android, Linux | Web UIs, Enterprise Software |
| Deployment | Local, Cloud, or Hybrid | Cloud-first |
| Visual UI Adaptability | High (self-healing) | Medium |
| Setup Time | Minutes via natural language prompts | Minutes to hours (depends on complexity) |

## Which Tool Should QA Teams Choose?

- **Choose AskUI if** your focus is on **cross-platform UI automation**, **vision-based testing**, and **low-code flexibility**.
- **Choose Adept if** you need **AI agents** to **plan and execute enterprise-grade workflows** across apps, systems, and data formats.

For hybrid environments, AskUI's flexibility in both local and cloud-based deployment may provide a more agile solution for QA testing pipelines.

## FAQ

### What makes AskUI better for UI testing?

AskUI mimics human vision to detect and interact with UI elements, making it highly robust to UI changes and layout updates.

### Can non-developers use AskUI or Adept?

AskUI is more beginner-friendly due to its plain-English prompt system. Adept may require more configuration for enterprise agents.

### Are both tools secure for enterprise use?

Yes, both tools offer enterprise-ready deployment options. AskUI can run locally for security-sensitive environments.

## Final Thoughts

AskUI and Adept take two different but powerful approaches to UI automation. AskUI empowers teams with visual interaction and natural language prompts across platforms, making it a flexible, accessible solution. In contrast, Adept's agent-based automation excels in navigating complex enterprise workflows with multimodal intelligence.

Your decision ultimately comes down to your use case. For visual UI testing and simplicity, AskUI is a great fit. For orchestrating end-to-end enterprise processes, Adept may be the stronger choice.
