## Traditional QA was designed for predictable, manually engineered software.
It relies on consistent code patterns, manual test cases, and multi-day validation cycles.

Static test cases**quickly become outdated as AI frameworks evolve your app’s structure.
Manual validation**is far too slow for weekly or even daily deployment cycles.
Regression suites**tied to DOM selectors or hardcoded APIs fail when AI modules dynamically change outputs.

🔍**Fact:**This aligns with broader*2025 Dev Productivity Benchmarks*showing teams using vision-based QA report**35–45% faster overall cycle times.**

## Teams often underestimate how much traditional QA slows or risks their AI projects.
Here’s why this matters more than ever:

Missed Bugs from Static Testing**
Automated scripts tied to fragile DOM or API contracts break whenever AI changes structures.
They fail to catch semantic or visual regressions like when an LLM slightly changes button labels or page context, but the old tests still pass.

Drag on Release Velocity**
Manual testers can’t keep up with codebases that update daily.
Every broken test suite needs human fixing, which adds hours or days.

Lost User Trust**
If AI-driven interfaces fail in subtle ways outdated recommendations, slightly misaligned UI elements users churn fast.

## Most vibe-driven developers prioritize speed-to-market.
They launch MVPs in days or weeks, integrate LLM-based features, and push frequent updates through CI/CD.

Without a strong QA strategy:
Users see bugs in production, leading to bad reviews and low adoption.

- Engineers waste cycles hotfixing after launch, which is dramatically more expensive.

## Our **What Makes This New Feature Different?

Vision-based Testing**
It doesn’t rely on DOM selectors.
Instead, it visually inspects your app just like a human would  catching layout shifts, wrong images, missing text, even if your HTML has completely changed.

✅**entire flow**, not just individual clicks.

Rapid Certification**
Most teams achieve certifications within a few hours  validating builds up to**✅**A Real-World Scenario: From Slow QA to Weekly Deployments

This mirrors what we've seen in cross-platform tests too including Android UI control where the agent completed a temperature adjustment task through vision alone, based on a single sentence prompt.

## Recent internal benchmarks show just how big the difference is.

## **actual rendered interface**, small HTML or DOM changes won’t break anything. It focuses on what users see and interact with.

Will it help with compliance and audit trails?**
Absolutely. Every validation is logged with screenshots and metadata  perfect evidence for security, privacy, and accessibility audits.

How does this affect engineering velocity?**
It replaces what used to take manual testers days, letting teams validate builds in hours.
You keep moving fast without sacrificing trust.

Can it really control interfaces without coding or selectors?**
Yes. In our beta demo, the agent changed a setting in an Android app using only a natural language instruction. It visually located the control, interacted with it, and confirmed the result — no backend access required.
