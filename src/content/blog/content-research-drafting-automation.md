## Research Smarter, Write Faster with Caesr

Caesr is our new natural language automation chat.

Caesr handles all the work by taking your own descriptions of requirements to create your content instead of requiring you to manually browse posts and note down information before drafting your content. And yes, Caesr works across multiple languages, so your research and writing can happen in any language you're most comfortable with.

## Turning Research into Action

Caesr can open websites, capture recent posts, summarize key insights, check trending hashtags, and produce a perfect draft with one request.

The process which required multiple hours of monotonous work now performs in a unified stream.

## How the Demo Unfolds

Here is the full prompt I used for this demo:

> "I need you to perform a complete social media intelligence and content drafting task from scratch. Adapt the tone of a confident and forward-thinking tech innovator for the final output. First, open a web browser. In separate tabs, navigate to the following LinkedIn URLs, read the three most recent posts, summarize the key themes, check trending hashtags, and draft a professional update in that tone."

Caesr executed the instructions step by step:

1. **Open multiple tabs** - navigated directly to the requested LinkedIn pages.
2. **Collected insights** – read the three most recent posts from each page.
3. **Summarized the key message** – extracted the core theme from every post.
4. **Checked hashtag trends** - reviewed hashtag trends to find out which hashtags were trending at that time.
5. **Generated a draft of the post** - created professional LinkedIn post in the desired style.

## Why This Use Case Stands Out

The demo shows that Caesr carries out responsibilities which go past standard task completion:

- **End-to-end flow** - from raw research to completed draft with one go.
- **Insight generation** - make insights by uniting various posts into a unified story.
- **Tone flexibility** - apply writing style what you want, from professional to casual.
- **Reusable method** - use the same prompt style for blogs, newsletters, or internal briefs.

## Ready for the Next Chapter

Researching and creating the drafts are just a start. The natural language approach functions to [simplify shopping operations](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/caesr-automate-shopping-with-a-single-prompt) as well as [invoice management](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/automate-invoice-to-excel-with-one-prompt) and scheduling processes.
