  "excerpt": "Switch from Legacy JS/TS functions to Caesr.AI.Use natural language AI Agents handle reusable logic eliminating code overhead and boosting automation.",
  "content": "<p id=\">The <strong id=\">TypeScript/JavaScript SDK is no longer the primary method within AskUI. It is now the previous generation</strong>. We strongly recommend <strong id=\">switching</strong> automation logic to the <strong id=\">Python SDK which is AskUI's primary language</strong> to leverage the full power of the Caesr.ai AI Agent platform. Stop writing unnecessary control flow functions and start telling the AI what you need.</p><h3 id=\">The Old Problem Coding Simple Logic</h3>\n\n<p id=\">In the previous generation automation environment achieving code reusability for conditional actions, like checking if an element is present and reacting to it, required writing custom utility functions. This approach created significant code maintenance overhead as developers were constantly writing repetitive logic.</p><h3 id=\">The New Solution Declarative Logic with Caesr.ai Prompts</h3>\n\n<p id=\">With <strong id=\">Caesr.ai</strong> the AI Agent handles complex control flow and conditional logic natively based on your instructions. The entire manual function is replaced by a single declarative sentence in the <strong id=\">Caesr.AI</strong> interface. This eliminates the need for coding, function definition, or maintenance.</p><h2 id=\">Caesr.ai Prompt Example Replacing Function Logic</h2>\n\n<pre></pre><h3 id=\">Role of the Python SDK</h3>\n\n<p id=\">While the <strong id=\">Caesr.AI</strong> is the primary <strong id=\">no-code</strong> interface for simple tasks, <strong id=\">the Python SDK remains the recommended method for developers</strong>. It acts as the powerful entry point for advanced users who require deeper integration. This includes setting up the test execution environment or integrating AI workflows into CI/CD pipelines.</p><p id=\">For other complex automation examples powered by a single prompt, explore:</p>\n\n<ul id=\"><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/caesr-analyze-tiktok-viral-trends\" id=\">Caesr: Analyze TikTok Viral Trends</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/one-prompt-full-website-qa\" id=\">One Prompt: Full Website QA</a></li></ul><h3 id=\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p id=\">The era of writing repetitive functions for basic automation logic is over. By migrating to Caesr.ai, you leverage the power of <strong id=\">natural language automation</strong> to create robust, reusable, and self-maintaining workflows, freeing your team from code maintenance.</p>",
