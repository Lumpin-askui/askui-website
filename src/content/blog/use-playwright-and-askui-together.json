  "title": "Bridging the Gap: Using Playwright and AskUI Together for Cross-Application Workflows",
  "excerpt": "The post summary covers Playwright's DOM limit vs. AskUI's AI visual automation to enable seamless cross-app testing (MFA, desktop).",
  "content": "<p id=\">Playwright serves as the dependable choice for performing complete web application tests which work across different browsers and operating systems. This tool operates through the Document Object Model (DOM) of browsers but lacks ability to access elements which exist beyond this environment including native desktop applications and system dialogues and complex canvas UIs. </p><p id=\">When your automation workflow is required to leave the web browser to interact with a desktop app for example, during a multi-factor authentication MFA process or file handling Playwright reaches its technical limit. This is where AskUI steps in. AskUI uses AI-powered visual recognition Computer Vision and human-like input simulation to automate tasks across any UI layer web, desktop, mobile, custom apps. </p><p id=\">The combination of Playwright for web stability with AskUI for cross-platform visual control enables you to develop complete end-to-end workflows that connect different applications.</p><h2 id=\">Prerequisites and Installation</h2><p id=\">To implement this hybrid approach, ensure you have the following components installed and configured:<strong id=\">‍</strong></p><p id=\"><strong id=\">1. AskUI:</strong> The AskUI controller must be installed and configured on your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).<strong id=\">‍</strong></p><p id=\"><strong id=\">2. Playwright Core:</strong> Install the Playwright package as a dev-dependency using <code>npm</code>.<br></p><pre id=\"></pre><p id=\"> 3. <strong id=\">Browser:</strong> Install the necessary browser binaries like Chromium)that Playwright will control.</p><pre id=\"></pre><h2 id=\">Configuring the Dual Environment</h2><p id=\">The core of the integration lies in configuring both tools to run within the same test context, typically handled in a setup file such as <code id=\">helpers/askui-helper.ts</code></p><p id=\">The key setup steps include:</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> <thead> <tr style=\"background-color: #f0f0f5; border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc;\"> <th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; width: 25%;\">Component</th> <th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; width: 35%;\">Action</th> <th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; width: 40%;\">Purpose</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\"> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd; font-weight: bold;\">Playwright Launch</td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">Use <code>chromium.launch({ headless: false, ... })</code></td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000;\">Crucial:</span> AskUI's visual automation requires a visible browser window to interact with; therefore, Playwright must run in <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">headed</span> mode.</td> </tr> <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; background-color: #fafafa;\"> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd; font-weight: bold;\">Playwright Context</td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">Create a <code>pwContext</code> and <code>page</code></td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">This context is exported and used by the test script for all DOM-based web interactions.</td> </tr> <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;\"> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd; font-weight: bold;\">AskUI Controller</td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">Initialize and <code>await uiController.start()</code></td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">Establishes the server that communicates with the operating system to perform actions like mouse movements and keypresses.</td> </tr> <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; background-color: #fafafa;\"> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd; font-weight: bold;\">AskUI Client</td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">Initialize and <code>await aui.connect()</code></td> <td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">Connects to the AskUI API, enabling the use of natural language-based visual selectors in the test.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div><p id=\">Both tools must be properly shut down in the <code id=\">afterAll</code> hook to ensure resource cleanup and isolation between tests.</p><h2 id=\">Writing a Hybrid Workflow (The Hand-off)</h2><p id=\">The test workflow demonstrates a smooth <strong id=\">hand-off</strong> from Playwright's structural automation to AskUI's visual automation.</p><h3 id=\">Example Scenario: Web Search and Visual Element Click</h3><p id=\">In this example, Playwright performs standard web navigation, and AskUI takes over to click an element based on its visual label.</p><pre id=\"></pre><p id=\">The core takeaway is how <code id=\">aui.mouseLeftClick().exec()</code> serves as the crucial technical step, <strong id=\">ensuring the browser window is actively focused</strong> on the desktop before AskUI initiates its visual recognition and simulation commands. AskUI then uses its visual engine to interact with elements regardless of the underlying DOM structure.</p><h2 id=\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\">The combination of Playwright with AskUI creates an advanced automated system which will maintain its functionality in upcoming years for executing intricate business operations. Playwright stands as the leading option for dependable web automation through structural methods yet AskUI provides essential functionality by allowing users to interact with desktop applications and native OS components and all visual elements that exist beyond the browser DOM. This integration ensures full coverage for all multi-step, cross-application scenarios.</p>",
