## Curriculum learning is an approach where the complexity of tasks introduced to an AI agent increases gradually, preventing overwhelming the agent early on.

### Training starts with basic tasks to establish competence before moving to more complex challenges involving intricate tool interactions or decision-making processes.

### Once simple tasks are mastered, agents are introduced to scenarios that demand sophisticated tools and strategies.

## When training vision AI agents, addressing generalizability, scalability, and incorporating human feedback is crucial.

Generalizability**ensures the agent can effectively manage diverse input scenarios.

Scalability**involves optimizing training to handle extensive datasets efficiently, possibly through distributed systems.

Human-in-the-Loop Learning**introduces human feedback, allowing real-time adjustments during training, ensuring a more adaptable learning experience.
