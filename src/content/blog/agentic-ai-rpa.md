## Why Should QA and Automation Teams Care About Combining Agentic AI and RPA?

Software teams today face relentless pressure: shorter release cycles, fragmented systems, and rising maintenance costs. Even well-established RPA implementations struggle when UIs change or processes span multiple platforms. This is exactly where Agentic AI steps in bridging gaps by introducing adaptive, context-aware automation that complements traditional RPA.

In many projects, teams leverage vision-based Agentic AI tools (like AskUI) to cover dynamic or visually complex workflows, ensuring automation doesn't break when applications evolve.

## What Is Agentic AI and How Does It Differ from Traditional RPA?

**Agentic AI** refers to goal-driven intelligent agents that interpret interfaces visually and make real-time decisions almost like human testers or operators. Unlike traditional bots, they:

- Rely on visual and contextual cues rather than static selectors
- Adjust dynamically to pop-ups, layout shifts, or unexpected UI states
- Seamlessly navigate across web, desktop, or even virtual environments

| Feature | Agentic AI (e.g., AskUI) | Traditional RPA |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision-making** | Contextual, dynamic | Rule-based, static |
| **UI handling** | Visual, cross-platform | DOM/xPath or selectors, limited |
| **Resilience** | Self-adjusts to UI changes | Prone to breaks, needs script fixes |
| **Coverage** | Hybrid apps, Citrix, VDI included | Mostly structured apps only |

## How Does Combining Agentic AI with RPA Enhance Automation?

**In short:** Agentic AI and RPA complement each other. RPA excels at stable, repetitive tasks, while Agentic AI handles exceptions and dynamic environments.

**By integrating the two:**

- RPA takes care of structured back-office workflows
- Agentic AI platforms like AskUI step in when UI variability or multi-platform processes appear
- Together, they reduce failures, manual interventions, and maintain a consistent automation pipeline

### Example Use Case

A QA team at a logistics company uses RPA for standard ERP data entry. When unexpected UI changes break scripts, their Agentic AI layer dynamically recognizes the new layouts and keeps workflows running—avoiding costly downtime.

## When Should You Consider Blending Agentic AI and RPA?

- **Rapidly changing UIs:** SaaS platforms with frequent updates or experiments
- **Hybrid or multi-platform processes:** Desktop + browser + mobile workflows
- **Critical operations:** Where automation failures could impact revenue
- **Reducing script maintenance:** Letting visual AI agents adapt on the fly

In fact, many teams start by layering tools like AskUI on top of existing RPA to tackle their most fragile or business-critical automations.

## What Are the Pros and Cons of Using Agentic AI with RPA?

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Strengthens automation resilience | May need initial integration effort |
| Reduces manual script maintenance | Could require upskilling teams |
| Extends coverage to complex environments | Slightly higher upfront investment |
| Future-proofs against UI volatility | |

## FAQs: Agentic AI + RPA

### Why pair Agentic AI with RPA instead of relying on one?

Agentic AI handles variability and unexpected UI changes, while RPA excels at structured, rule-driven workflows. Combining them balances adaptability with efficiency.

### What types of teams benefit most from this approach?

Teams managing hybrid environments, frequent UI updates, or needing to automate Citrix/VDI scenarios typically gain the most from layering Agentic AI with existing RPA.

### How does this reduce maintenance overhead?

Agentic AI dynamically adapts to interface changes, cutting down the frequent script reworks often required by traditional RPA alone.

### Is it possible to pilot this on a small process first?

Absolutely. Many organizations start by integrating Agentic AI into a single fragile workflow before scaling across broader operations.

### Can it extend automation to previously 'untestable' apps?

Yes. Visual AI enables automation even where traditional RPA selectors fail—like in legacy desktop apps or virtualized environments.

## Future-Proof Your Automation Strategy

Combining Agentic AI with RPA isn't just a technical upgrade—it's a way to make your automation smarter, more resilient, and ready for whatever comes next. Whether you want to reduce manual maintenance or tackle complex multi-platform workflows, the synergy of these tools can transform how your team operates.
