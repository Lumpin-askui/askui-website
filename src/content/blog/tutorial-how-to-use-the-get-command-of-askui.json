  "content": "<p id=\">This tutorial will show you how you can utilize AskUIs <em id=\">get()</em>-command to write more powerful automation.</p><p id=\">Until now askuis-SDK is only allowed to test for the existence of an element with the <em id=\">exists()</em>-command. While that was useful, extracting information about elements such as text was impossible. If you wanted to act based on elements values or assert a state of an element with an assertion library, you could not do that!</p><p id=\">With the new <em id=\">get()</em>-command you can extract the information askui inferred. Many more automation possibilities become available 🔥.</p><p id=\">We will show you how to assert if a textfield contains a text we tried to insert beforehand. Additionally, we will demonstrate how the <em id=\">get()</em> command works regarding relational selectors as <em id=\">below()</em>.</p><h2 id=\">Prerequisites</h2><ul id=\"><li id=\">You have AskUI installed (<a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/general/Getting%20Started/Installing%20AskUI/getting-started\" id=\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/general/Getting%20Started/Installing%20AskUI/getting-started-linux\" id=\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/general/Getting%20Started/Installing%20AskUI/getting-started-macos\" id=\">macOS</a>)</li><li id=\">You can access <a href=\"https://selectorshub.com/xpath-practice-page/\" id=\">this practice page</a></li></ul><h2 id=\">Write to A Textfield</h2><p id=\">For our test, we first write a mobile telephone number into the textfield <em id=\">Mobile Number</em> on the practice page.</p><pre></pre><h2 id=\">Is There a Textfield Containing our Number?</h2><p id=\">Let us now see if there is a textfield that contains a text with the mobile number we just entered.</p><pre></pre><p id=\">It should print out the following:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Notice that there is no text in there as the mobile number is <strong id=\">contained</strong> in the textfield as a <em id=\">text</em> element.</p><h2 id=\">Is It the Correct Textfield?</h2><p id=\">Ok, so there is a textfield containing the correct number. But is it the correct textfield?</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Should log this:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">With this you can now do assertions with your favorite library or manually:</p><pre></pre><h2 id=\">Additional Considerations for get()</h2><p id=\">When you use <em id=\">get()</em>, you must pay attention to two details to avoid stumbling upon them.</p><h3 id=\">UI Changes</h3><p id=\">When the UI changes the detected elements usually change. They may be moved to a new position, disappear entirely, or be populated with new data.</p><p id=\">Thus the elements you saved into a variable may get invalid. Be aware of this fact and update your elements when you need an updated version.</p><h2 id=\">Why Is the Sorting All Jumbled up Sometimes?</h2><p id=\">The <em id=\">get()</em> command returns an ordered list based on the <em id=\">\"distance\"</em> of the elements. The distance is not entirely based upon physical distance, but also takes into consideration the similarity when you use <em id=\">withText()</em>. It also considers special cases, for example, modal dialogs. Therefore the order can be nonsensical when you look at it from a human perspective!</p><p id=\">Let us demonstrate this with an example. With a relational selector, you can do something like this.</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Take this example from our practice page:</p><figure id=\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:620px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"620px\"><div id=\"><img src=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6634d1c875203658e8438b5e_6369367b45bc9515ee9fca6b_tutorial_get_command.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Textfields with labels over a Submit-button\" id=\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\">If you try to get everything above the <em id=\">Submit</em> button, you will get the following elements. The first two elements make sense but the third element seems to be out of order:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">If you want to sort it by <em id=\">ymin</em> for example, you have to implement a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#description\" id=\">comparator function</a> and pass it to the <em id=\">sort()</em> function of the array.</p><pre></pre><p id=\">For sorting based on the distance of the center of the bounding boxes of each element <a href=\"https://dev.to/johannesdienst/sort-boundingboxes-for-fun-in-typescript-mgb\" id=\">take a look at this article</a>.</p><h2 id=\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\">If you pay attention to the pitfalls of <em id=\">get()</em> it is a powerful tool to get more out of your automation efforts.</p><h2 id=\">Get Support</h2><p id=\"><a href=\"https://askui.circle.so/getting-started\">If you have a recurring or persisting issue, don’t hesitate to ask the community for help!</a></p>",
