Can One Prompt Really Transform Invoices?

From Invoice to Excel: How the Demo Works

*Example prompt“Read the invoice currently visible on the screen. Extract the client name, date, order number, and item list with prices and quantities. Then open Excel and enter the client name in cell B1, the date in cell B2, and the order number in cell B3. Add headers ‘Item’, ‘Qty’, and ‘Price’ in row 5, then fill in the extracted items starting from row 6 with name in column A, quantity in column B, and price in column C. Leave one empty row after the last item.”

Read the invoice data - read the client name, data, order, number, and item details from the PDF and extracted.

1. Insert client info - filled A1-B3 with the client info , date, and order number.

2. Populated the table - filled each row with the datas were extracted by Caesr.
