  "excerpt": "Switch from Legacy JS/TS functions to Caesr.AI. AI Agents use natural language to handle all logic and assertions, eliminating code maintenance.",
  "content": "<h3 id=\">IMPORTANT Transition to AI Agent Automation</h3><p id=\">The <strong id=\">TypeScript/JavaScript SDK is no longer the primary method within AskUI. It is now the previous generation</strong>. We strongly recommend <strong id=\">switching</strong> automation logic to the Python SDK to leverage the full power of the Caesr.ai AI Agent platform. Stop writing unnecessary control flow functions and start telling the AI what you need.</p><h2 id=\">The Old Problem Complex Code for Data Extraction and Assertions</h2><p id=\">The previous automation environment needed developers to create complex multi-step code for reliable assertion testing. Developers had to use TypeScript/JavaScript code like regular expressions and array manipulation to parse data extracted by<code> aui.get()</code>, and then rely on external libraries like Jest to check the result. This system complexity resulted in increased test instability and extended maintenance duration.</p><h3 id=\">The New Solution AI-Powered Declarative Verification</h3><p id=\">Caesr.ai streamlines this entire process.It performs data extraction and conditional logic and verification tasks through its integrated vision and language models which respond to basic natural language instructions. This system eliminates the requirement for manual parsing operations and external assertion libraries</p><h4 id=\">Caesr.ai Prompt Example Replacing Manual Assertion Logic</h4><p id=\">The AI Agent handles the entire workflow autonomously, from reading the dynamic CAPTCHA to verifying the final state.</p><pre></pre><h3 id=\">Role of the Python SDK</h3><p id=\">While <strong id=\">Caesr.AI</strong> is the primary <strong id=\">no-code</strong> interface for simple tasks, <strong id=\">the Python SDK remains the recommended method for developers</strong>. It acts as the powerful entry point for advanced users who require deeper integration. This includes setting up the test execution environment or integrating AI workflows into <strong id=\">CI/CD pipelines</strong>.</p><p id=\">For other complex automation examples powered by a single prompt, explore:</p><ul id=\"><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/caesr-analyze-tiktok-viral-trends\" id=\">Caesr: Analyze TikTok Viral Trends</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/one-prompt-full-website-qa\" id=\">One Prompt: Full Website QA</a></li></ul><h3 id=\">Conclusion</h3><p id=\">Caesr.ai fundamentally changes how assertions are done. By moving away from brittle TypeScript parsing and external Jest dependencies, you gain <strong id=\">robustness and clarity</strong>. Trust the AI Agent to handle the extraction and verification, allowing your team to build highly stable UI workflows with minimal code.</p>",
