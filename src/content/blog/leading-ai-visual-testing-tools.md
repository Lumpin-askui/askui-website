But what if AI could not only detect visual differences but also understand their*significance*? This is the promise of**At AskUI, we’ve witnessed firsthand the evolution of this critical field. The guide assesses top AI-based visual regression testing solutions through their methods to assist you in selecting the optimal solution for achieving perfect UI consistency.

## Visual testing in the past required users to perform pixel-by-pixel screenshot comparisons. The system worked well to detect changes but it struggled with the dynamic nature of modern user interfaces which evolve rapidly.  Furthermore, it generates noise output when it identifies minimal font rendering differences and normal animations and minor layout modifications.
