When we showed[So, we are not here to talk about what kind of features our product have. We’re here to share with you the community that has shown us about the future of our industry. We analyzed the patterns, the choices and the behaviors of this incredible user base, and we found a few massive changes underway.

**If there is one amazing phenomenon our launch data showed us, it is that teams are no longer looking for temporary solutions for brittle, the tests that are based on selector, but are instead demanding a basic paradigm change.

Teams are no longer just seeking for a ‘better selector.’ They are actively adopting a new paradigm that is unbreakable by design and does not require selectors at all. This is not just a trend. It’s the beginning of a huge transformation.

## Trend 2: Generative AI is Solving the Challenge in Test Creation, Not just Execution **

Teams that used Caesr.ai's ability to automatically generate test , by visually analyzing real user session recording were able to expand their test coverage 40% faster on average in the first month. This shows developers or QA engineers can now use their time effectively on repetitive script writing and concentrate on more complex, creative problem solving. Speeding up test creation is becoming a key driver for accelerating the entire development process.

## Trend 3 : When Automation Becomes a ‘Language’, Not just ‘Code’, True Collaboration Begins **

Our collaboration features, such as integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams and shared dashboards, saw three times more usage than we projected. What’s especially remarkable is that because AskUI’s automation scripts are composed of human-readable, natural language like ‘Click the button with the shopping cart icon’, non-developers like PMs or designers can easily understand the test and actively participate in the quality conversation.

**Based on the data, we can see a clear picture of 2026. The future of test automation is defined by visual stability that exceeds selectors, accelerated test creation with AI and open collaboration based on natural language.
