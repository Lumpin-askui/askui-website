  "content": "<p id=\">Are you struggling to integrate test data into your AskUI workflows effectively? Do you find yourself juggling APIs, CSV files, and databases without a clear approach?<br></p><p id=\">Integrating test data from various sources can be a daunting task.<br></p><p id=\">By the end of this post, you'll have a foundation for integrating test data into your AskUI workflows using APIs, CSV files, and databases.</p><h2 id=\">Integrate API</h2>\n\n<p id=\">To use an API for fetching test data, you'll need a library like `axios`. After installing it, import it into your AskUI workflow file and use it to call an API, extract data, and insert it into a text field.</p><pre></pre><h2 id=\">Reading from CSV Files</h2>\n\n<p id=\">For integrating CSV files and databases, let's dive into a combined example. Begin by installing the required libraries and adding the necessary imports to your AskUI workflow file. First, read the CSV file into your code and parse it:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Our CSV data looks like this. Save it as `data.csv` in the root-folder of your AskUI project:</p><pre></pre><h2 id=\">‍<strong id=\">Create and Initialize Database</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">Next, create a database on your file system, within the same project as your Ascii workflow file. Set up a schema by opening the database and creating a table:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Once completed, you'll have successfully integrated test data into your AskUI workflow using both CSV files and databases.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Insert Data into Database</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">Now that we have our database and table set up, we'll insert the parsed CSV data into the database. To do this, iterate over each row of the CSV data and use a SQL statement to insert it:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">If you don't have a CSV file, you can follow a similar approach to the previous example, where you read data directly from the database and integrate it into your code like this:<br></p><pre></pre><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">We provided examples of incorporating test data into your AskUI workflow using APIs, CSV files, or databases. While these examples are not comprehensive, they serve as a solid starting point for integrating test data into your projects.</p>",
