## Vision-based UI testing uses computer vision and AI to validate what users actually see on screen.

It's how fast-moving dev teams ensure the quality of AI-built apps without relying on brittle selectors or pixel-perfect scripts.

## Script-based tests often miss visual bugs. You might confirm a button exists in the DOM but a user still can’t click it because it’s hidden by a modal.

looks*and*Bugs That Vision-Based Testing Finds (That Scripts Can’t)
Overlapping UI elements

- Invisible but clickable components

- Layout breaks in responsive views

- These visual bugs can silently degrade UX, especially in AI-generated interfaces where layout logic may be inferred rather than hand-coded.

## With vision-based automation, your test agent behaves like a human tester:
Opens your app (desktop, browser, hybrid).

1. Follows natural language prompts like: “Open the product page and confirm the ‘Buy Now’ button is clearly visible.”

2. No selectors. No DOM. Just pure on-screen validation.

## AskUI’s new launching chat your personal AI test engineer runs vision-based UI checks across OS platforms.

3. Use natural language to define workflows

4. Integrate with PyTest and CI/CD pipelines

Sample Workflow: Real Bug, Real Catch

Comparison: Vision vs Scripted Testing

<div data-rt-embed-type="true">

| Capability | Vision-Based (AskUI) | Script-Based |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detects Visual Bugs | Yes — sees what users see | No — limited to DOM logic |
| Uses Natural Language | Yes — human-readable prompts | No — requires scripting |
| Cross-Platform Support | Yes — macOS, Windows, Linux | Partial — varies by setup |
| Handles UI Obstructions | Yes — detects overlays, hidden buttons | No — often misses visual overlaps |
| Setup Time | Minimal — no selectors | Extensive — write & maintain scripts |

## How is this different from screenshot comparison?

Can it catch issues that DOM-based tests pass?

What’s the best use case?

Does it support headless testing in CI/CD?
