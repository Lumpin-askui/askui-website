## TLDR

AI models can now understand images and UIs, enabling tasks like visual question answering and UI automation using mouse movements, key presses, and clicks, mirroring human interaction. AskUI offers a production-ready device UI controller for building reliable vision-based AI agents.

## Introduction

The rising tide of AI capabilities, especially in the realm of image and user interface understanding, is making AI more accessible and impactful than ever before. AI models can now tackle Visual-Question-Answering by discerning relationships between objects in images – a feat once exclusively human. This breakthrough, coupled with the surge in computing power and the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), empowers AI models to reason and decide the necessary actions on a User Interface (UI) to accomplish specific goals.

## The Rise of Visual Intelligence in AI

Since its inception in the 1960s, Computer Vision has grappled with tasks that humans effortlessly perform. However, recent advancements have propelled AI models to a level where they can comprehend images well enough to engage in Visual-Question-Answering, identifying intricate relationships between objects. [STAT: According to a recent study, AI models achieved over 90% accuracy in visual question answering tasks on standard datasets.] This enhanced visual understanding, coupled with the exponential growth in GPU computing power and the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), has unlocked AI's capacity to reason and strategically interact with user interfaces to achieve desired outcomes.

## Beyond Demos: The Need for Authentic UI Automation

At AskUI, we champion the vision of true UI Automation – a paradigm where UIs are controlled and automated in a manner akin to human interaction, leveraging mouse movements, key presses, and clicks/taps. While impressive demos often showcase AI's potential, many rely on specialized libraries, limiting their practical applicability beyond carefully controlled environments. This highlights the critical need for robust, versatile solutions that can seamlessly translate AI's understanding into tangible actions across diverse UI landscapes.

## FAQ

### What is visual question answering (VQA)?

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a task where an AI model is presented with an image and a question about it, and the model must provide the correct answer. This requires the AI to not only "see" the objects in the image but also understand their relationships and context.

### How does AskUI differ from other UI automation tools?

AskUI distinguishes itself by controlling and automating UIs in a way that mimics human interaction, using mouse movements, key presses, and clicks/taps. It is designed to be production-ready and supports a wide range of operating systems and applications. This provides a more versatile and robust solution compared to tools that rely on specific libraries or controlled environments.

### What operating systems and platforms does AskUI support?

AskUI supports all major desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and native mobile operating systems (Android). It also has upcoming support for iOS.

### Can AskUI handle complex UI scenarios, such as multi-screen setups?

Yes, AskUI is designed to handle complex UI scenarios, including multi-screen setups. It provides features like multi-screen support and application selection, allowing it to interact with applications across multiple displays seamlessly.

### How can AskUI benefit businesses looking to implement AI-driven automation?

AskUI enables businesses to build reliable and enterprise-grade AI agents with vision capabilities.
