## What is AskUI?

AskUI is an AI-driven test automation platform that uses **visual recognition and natural language processing** to intelligently navigate applications. It seamlessly automates workflows across **desktop, web, mobile, and canvas-based UIs**, minimizing fragile code dependencies.

- **Prompt-to-Action (PTA):** Lets teams create automation flows in plain English, so even non-developers can contribute to test scenarios.
- **Pre-trained & Custom Models:** Offers out-of-the-box automation frameworks like PTA and UIDT, while also supporting tailored models built on your data.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Supports MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Android, with options for on-premise, cloud, or hybrid—ideal for companies with strict data governance.
- **Integration Ecosystem:** Connects with Zapier, n8n, Docker, Jenkins and more, adapting easily to existing pipelines.

Many QA teams choose AskUI to lower maintenance costs, since visual automation tends to be less brittle against frequent UI changes—helping extend test lifespan and stability.

## What is Testsigma?

Testsigma is a **cloud-based platform for unified test automation**, designed to accelerate end-to-end QA cycles with its broad device lab and AI-enhanced scripting.

- **Test Coverage:** Handles web, mobile, desktop, API, and Salesforce testing.
- **GenAI Scripting:** Allows teams to generate and maintain tests in natural language with generative AI assistance.
- **Distributed Device Lab:** Runs tests across 3000+ browser and device combinations in the cloud.
- **Extensive Resources:** Includes tutorials, documentation, blogs, and webinars to support onboarding and scaling.

As enterprises move toward multi-platform products, many look to tools like Testsigma for large-scale cloud executions and quick coverage expansion.

## How Do AskUI and Testsigma Compare?

Here's a side-by-side feature comparison to help identify which solution best aligns with your QA priorities.

| Feature | AskUI | Testsigma |
|---|---|---|
| **Target Applications** | Desktop, web, mobile, canvas | Web, mobile, desktop, API, Salesforce |
| **AI Integration** | Visual recognition + natural language | GenAI-powered automation |
| **User Interaction** | Define flows in plain English (PTA) | Plain English scripts + GenAI generation |
| **Deployment** | On-prem, cloud, hybrid | Cloud-only |
| **Primary Focus** | Making UI automation accessible to diverse teams | Accelerating large-scale end-to-end testing |

## Why Teams Prefer AskUI

- **Plain English Automation:** AskUI's PTA bridges gaps between QA and business users, enabling broader team collaboration without code.
- **Non-Browser Interfaces:** Excels at automating desktop and canvas-based UIs that many tools overlook.
- **Controlled Deployment:** On-premise and hybrid setups keep sensitive data in-house, supporting compliance in regulated sectors.

This approach ensures AskUI stays subtly positioned as a versatile, security-conscious choice without overt sales language.

## When to Consider Testsigma

- **Cloud Scale:** Best for organizations that prioritize vast device/browser coverage with minimal infrastructure overhead.
- **AI Maintenance:** GenAI streamlines test creation and upkeep, reducing manual intervention.
- **Onboarding Resources:** Their rich library of guides helps teams quickly get productive.

## FAQs: AskUI vs Testsigma

### Do both platforms support no-code or low-code automation?

Yes. AskUI uses natural language-driven flows (PTA) while Testsigma combines plain English scripting with GenAI-powered test building.

### Which is better for non-browser automation like desktop apps or design canvases?

AskUI stands out here, using visual AI to automate native desktop and canvas interfaces that many cloud platforms don't fully handle.

### Can Testsigma be deployed on-premise?

No. Testsigma is built exclusively for cloud use. For teams needing local or hybrid deployments, AskUI offers those options.
