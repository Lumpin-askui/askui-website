What Are Vision Agents?

Imagine a security camera not just recording but also understanding events and executing actions based on specific instructions. Consider a manufacturing environment where defects are identified and reported in real time, enhancing quality control efficiency. These scenarios exemplify the potential of deploying vision agents on edge devices.

## While cloud solutions for visual AI exist, edge devices offer unique benefits:

### Processing data locally eliminates the delays associated with cloud transmission, enabling real-time responsiveness crucial for time-sensitive applications.

### On-device data processing addresses privacy and security concerns, crucial for sectors like healthcare and home monitoring.

### Edge deployment allows users, especially those in areas with unreliable internet, to benefit from vision agents' capabilities.

## The deployment of vision agents on edge devices can be facilitated using Jetson Platform Services, which provides a suite of microservices designed to build robust applications. Developers can utilize these services to deploy generative AI models such as VLMs. An illustrative application described is a fire detection system that processes video streams and sends alerts to mobile devices in real time.

## Beyond their functional capabilities, vision agents on edge devices offer a transformative opportunity: they democratize the development of visual AI applications.

## Traditionally, building visual AI systems requires specialized knowledge and extensive coding. The abundance of vision models and complex APIs can overwhelm developers.
