## Meet Caesr

Caesr is our new natural language automation chat. Instead of writing scripts or clicking through apps, you just type what you want, and Caesr executes it step by step across applications, exactly like a human would.

## Can One Prompt Really Automate Shopping?

Yes, with Caesr. You can buy anything online by typing with one sentence.

Instead of scrolling, searching, and clicking endless pages, you tell what you want, the rest of it can be handled by Caesr!

## From Prompt to Cart: How the Demo Works

Here is the prompt I used for Caesr testing:

> **Example prompt**  
> "Open Chrome, go to Amazon search for foot hammock, and add one marked as Amazon's overall pick to my basket."

Caesr turned the complete workflow from single prompt.

1. **Open Chrome** - started with new tab.
2. **Navigate to the store** - went directly to Amazon.
3. **Search for the Product that I want** - typed "foot hammock" in the search bar.
4. **Choose the item** - selected the product marked as Amazon's "Overall Pick".
5. **Add to my basket** - by adding to my cart, finished the task.

This video shows how Caesr understand natural language, translate it into UI interactions, and performed each action like a human.

## Why this is Game changer
