You have dry, sensitive skin and have had two documented allergic reactions to new skincare brands in the past year. You are budget-conscious, preferring products under €25, but you are willing to spend up to €35 if the product promises 'no irritation' (Data X #1: Safety & Price Sensitivity). You were thrown onto the product page after searching for 'best ampoule for sensitive skin' (Data X #2: High Intent). Your mission is to gain 100% confidence to purchase this €29.95 product. This requires quickly validating two things: 1) A clear safety signal (Hypoallergenic or Sensitive Skin Tested badge,claim) and 2) Value justification (e.g.Free shipping threshold, discount code, or volume benefit).
