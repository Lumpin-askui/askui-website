  "content": "<p id=\">User interface automation is hard. Especially when you rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to target text.</p><p id=\">AskUI is no stranger to this challenge. While our base-vision-model works great for most of the texts you want to target. It suffers from flakiness with specific fonts sometimes, too.</p><p id=\">But the cool thing is, that OCR's recognition rate can be greatly increased by retraining our base model with your specific text elements. For this we created the <strong id=\">AskUI Teaching App</strong> where you upload a screenshot that gets analyzed. Then you can check each text element that has been detected and correct falsy recognition.</p><p id=\">This tutorial will walk you through the process step-by-step.</p><h2 id=\">Prerequisites</h2><ul id=\"><li id=\">Installed AskUI Suite with the installer in version &gt;=24.9.1: <a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/general/Getting%20Started/Installing%20AskUI/getting-started\" id=\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/general/Getting%20Started/Installing%20AskUI/getting-started-macos\" id=\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/general/Getting%20Started/Installing%20AskUI/getting-started-linux\" id=\">Linux</a></li></ul><h2 id=\">Create a Screenshot with the Flaky Text Elements</h2><p id=\">Flakiness often happens in specific situations and you probably know exactly in which. Take a screenshot of the whole screen for each of those situations and save them in a folder. Here is the one I use for this tutorial:</p><figure id=\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"><img src=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/670a5651880712e316e827e6_670a5453c16d61a811c22e2a_practice-page-snippet.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The image shows a webpage titled &quot;AskUI Practice Page&quot; featuring a calculator interface.
