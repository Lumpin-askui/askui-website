  "content": "<p id=\">When you automate workflows you can <strong id=\">NOT</strong> focus solely on the <em id=\">happy path</em> where everything works as expected. The real world is way more complicated.<br></p><p id=\">Especially when you automate User Interfaces (UI) you have to deal with elements that only sometimes appear in special cases, pop-ups that jump in your face and block access to other elements. Or the workflow has some inherent variance you need to account for.<br></p><p id=\">In AskUI you can deal with all of these things by checking for conditions and choosing a different path through your workflow!<br></p><p id=\">This blog post explains how to implement preconditions, so your workflows become managable and stable.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">The Example</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">To illustrate the approach we will automate the <strong id=\"><em id=\">Dark/Light</em></strong>-theme-switcher on the <a href=\"https://askui.github.io/askui-practice-page/\" id=\">AskUI Practice Page</a> in the top right corner.</p><figure id=\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"><img src=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6717c2c46b1795d1fed93b98_6657204b10d142af7f6ab428_askui-practice-page-start.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"></div><figcaption id=\">AskUI Practice Page start in light theme.</figcaption></figure><p id=\">‍<br></p><p id=\">Depending on the theme that is currently active the text of the button changes between <strong id=\">Switch to Dark</strong> and <strong id=\">Switch to Light</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Step 1: Check for an Element to Exist</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">To illustrate the mechanics we first want to check if we are currently in the <em id=\">Light</em>-theme by trying to <strong id=\"><em id=\">get()</em></strong> the text-element <strong id=\"><em id=\">Switch to Dark</em></strong>. <strong id=\"><em id=\">get()</em></strong> will always return an array. And if the element was found it will have at least one element in it, if not the array is empty (<a href=\"https://docs.askui.com/docs/api/Getters/get\" id=\">Check the API docs</a>).</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Now we can check if we can safely click the switch button by verifying the array is not empty:</p><pre></pre><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Step2: Also Check for Other Variant</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">Let us now make our workflow adjust to the reality that the practice page can be either in dark or in light mode. In dark mode the button has the label <strong id=\"><em id=\">Switch to Light</em></strong>. We try to <strong id=\"><em id=\">get()</em></strong> this text first:</p><pre></pre><p id=\">Then we add an <strong id=\"><em id=\">else if</em></strong> to the check for the light theme. So depending on the existence of <strong id=\"><em id=\">Switch to Dark</em></strong> or <strong id=\"><em id=\">Switch to Light</em></strong> the button is clicked and the theme is switched in any case:</p><pre></pre><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Step 3: Encapsulate Code into a Function</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">Putting all this code in your workflow may be maintainable for a small workflow. But once you have a lot of code you want to move it into a separate function and call it. This also makes it more maintainable and reusable by different workflows.</p><pre></pre><figure id=\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"><img src=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6630f90ff7431b0c5b1bb0e7/6717c2c46b1795d1fed93b94_66572164ac5d1a8170cd600a_askui_practice_page.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"></div><figcaption id=\">Running the workflow two times in a row, so it clicks on the switch theme button twice.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"><strong id=\">Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p id=\">By using conditions in your workflow your workflow will become more stable as it can recover from deviations from the <em id=\">happy path</em>. You can use this technique to automate preconditions that need to be fulfilled for a workflow to run successfully.<br></p><p id=\">For example making sure that a user is logged in, or that the UI is in a desired state.</p>",
