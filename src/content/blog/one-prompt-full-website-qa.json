Simulate a real user journey and cover the following scenarios in order:<br><br> 1) <b>User Onboarding & Authentication</b> — On the homepage, scroll to the bottom to confirm all sections render; scroll back to the top; locate “Sign in with Google”; attempt to sign in; report whether auth completes, fails, or stalls.<br> 2) <b>Mobile Shopping & Responsive Design</b> — Navigate to <b>All Products</b>; set viewport to <b>400px</b> width; slowly scroll the entire product list like a shopper; note any overlaps, broken layouts, or text overflow.<br> 3) <b>Content Discovery & Performance</b> — In desktop view on <b>All Products</b>, scroll to the very bottom; click <b>Load More</b>; measure and report the time (seconds) until new products fully render.<br> 4) <b>End-to-End Search & Filter</b> — From the homepage, go to <b>All Products</b>; scroll at least two rows; open a specific product (e.g., “Handmade Ceramic Mug”); on the detail page verify title, image, price are visible; go back; search for <b>“ceramic”</b>; apply the <b>$51–$100</b> price filter; verify only items in that range appear.<br> 5) <b>Information Architecture & Footer Navigation</b> — Return to the homepage; scroll to the absolute bottom; in the footer, find <b>Shipping &amp; Returns</b> (may be small text); open it and confirm it navigates to the shipping policy page.<br><br> For each issue, categorize severity (<b>Critical / Major / Minor</b>), add a suspected root cause, a proposed fix, and attach a screenshot with clear annotations. </blockquote></div><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b0a8d83a510740b78f9cf77605171c0d\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border-radius:12px;\"></iframe></div><h3 id=\"><strong id=\">How Caesr Ran the Test</strong><br></h3><p id=\">Caesr parsed the instruction and carried out a <strong id=\">full QA flow</strong>:</p><ul id=\"><li id=\"><strong id=\">Onboarding &amp; Login</strong> — scrolled the homepage, tested Google sign-in, and confirmed post-auth state.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Responsive Design</strong> — resized to 400px, scrolled product listings, and flagged layout issues.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Performance</strong> — measured how long it took “Load More” to render new products.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Search &amp; Filter</strong> — searched for “ceramic,” applied price filters, and validated the results.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Footer Navigation</strong> — found “Shipping &amp; Returns” and confirmed correct page navigation.</li></ul><h3 id=\"><strong id=\">Why It Matters</strong></h3><ul id=\"><li id=\"><strong id=\">Realistic coverage</strong> — duplicate the way users would naturally interact with the site.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Structured reporting</strong> — provides structured reporting which includes severity ratings and both cause identification and solution recommendations for each issue.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Faster iteration</strong> — becomes faster because developers eliminate the need to recreate their scripts for each regression cycle.</li></ul><p id=\">Caesr helps QA teams and developers who work at startup speed maintain testing operations at the same speed as their shipping process.</p><h3 id=\"><strong id=\">Automation Without Limits</strong><br></h3><p id=\">Website QA is just one application.
