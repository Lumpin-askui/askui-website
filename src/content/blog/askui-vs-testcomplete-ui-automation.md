## What's the key difference between AskUI and TestComplete?

AskUI focuses on AI-powered, vision-based UI automation across platforms using natural language inputs. TestComplete emphasizes robust, code-free or coded test automation with SmartBear HaloAI enhancements.

Both tools help QA teams streamline UI testing, but their strengths differ based on team structure, test complexity, and technical needs.

## How does AskUI's AI-driven approach work?

AskUI uses computer vision and natural language to automate UI interactions. It mimics human behavior by recognizing UI elements visually rather than relying on fragile selectors.

- **Prompt-to-Action (PTA):** Converts plain English commands into UI actions
- **UIDT model:** Learns and adapts from user-provided data
- **PTA-1 architecture:** 270M parameter model built on Florence-2, hosted on Hugging Face
- **No-code automation:** Ideal for QA teams with minimal coding experience
- **Supported OS:** MacOS, Windows, Android, Linux

AskUI supports local, cloud, and hybrid deployments and integrates with Zapier, Docker, Jenkins, and more. It also automates Citrix and Remote Desktop environments using vision-based recognition.

## What does TestComplete offer for UI automation?

TestComplete is a mature test automation platform with a wide range of features:

- **Codeless or coded tests:** Record-and-replay or script-based workflows
- **SmartBear HaloAI:** For OCR, self-healing tests, and test data generation
- **Broad integration:** Works with Git, Jira, Jenkins, Azure DevOps
- **Over 500 UI controls supported**
- **Free trial with access to 500+ remote test environments**

Its strength lies in GUI testing across web, desktop, and mobile apps.

## What are AskUI's unique advantages?

AskUI provides a modern, AI-native experience ideal for future-ready QA teams:

- **Natural Language Interface:** Automate with simple English commands
- **Cross-platform coverage:** Supports canvas-based, Citrix, desktop, and mobile apps
- **Minimal setup:** No need to define fragile selectors manually
- **Customizable AI:** Train models with your own data (PTA-1)

These strengths make it well-suited for startups, SMEs, and teams seeking agility.

## When should teams choose TestComplete?

Choose TestComplete if you need:

- Enterprise-grade support and documentation
- Support for legacy systems with standard object repositories
- Integration with DevOps pipelines and enterprise tools
- Flexibility between codeless and coded tests

It is especially valuable in large organizations with mixed-technical QA teams.
