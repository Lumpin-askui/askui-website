Symbolic AI, on the other hand, focuses on representing knowledge through symbols and rules. This approach excels at logical reasoning and providing clear explanations. However, symbolic AI systems often require extensive hand-crafted knowledge and can struggle to handle the complexities and uncertainties of the real world.
