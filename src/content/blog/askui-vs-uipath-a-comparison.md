## What fundamentally sets AskUI apart from UiPath?

AskUI is purpose-built for AI-driven UI automation, focusing on visually recognizing elements on a screen. In contrast, UiPath serves as a large-scale enterprise platform, orchestrating end-to-end business processes across multiple departments. Their goals are different: AskUI aims to simplify interface interactions, while UiPath targets holistic process transformation.

## How does AskUI streamline UI automation for QA teams?

AskUI employs advanced computer vision to interpret screen elements like a human would. Its **Prompt-to-Action (PTA)** feature lets testers write steps conversationally, without managing fragile selectors or intricate scripts.

👉 **Why this matters:**

- Supports cross-platform automation on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
- Handles diverse UI contexts, including desktop apps, browsers, mobile views, and even canvas-heavy interfaces.
- Integrates effortlessly into CI/CD with Jenkins, n8n, Zapier, or Docker.

This lowers technical hurdles, empowering QA teams of all backgrounds to define tests without deep programming expertise.

## What is UiPath's approach to enterprise automation?

UiPath takes automation far beyond the screen. It structures initiatives into three core stages:

1. **Discover:** Uses process mining and communications analysis to pinpoint high-value automation opportunities.
2. **Automate:** Offers tools for building UI and API workflows, extracting data from documents, and creating low-code apps — all underpinned by AI.
3. **Operate:** Delivers dashboards, continuous testing, and governance frameworks to maintain reliable automations at scale.

👉 **Ideal for:**  
Companies seeking to streamline entire business functions, not just QA processes.
