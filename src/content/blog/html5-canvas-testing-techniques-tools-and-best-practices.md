Why? Because to most automation tools, the HTML5 Canvas is a**

<canvas>`element in the code, hiding all its complex buttons, charts, and characters from traditional automation. As the team behind AskUI, we’ve focused our efforts on solving this exact problem. Traditional automation is blind to what’s inside the canvas, but our Intelligent Vision AI Agent was built to see it.
