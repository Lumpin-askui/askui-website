## Caesr for Test Generation

QA teams spend most of their time on repetitive and time-consuming test suite development.

The analysis of each button and form field and navigation element requires complete coverage of all cases including both normal usage and boundary conditions.

Caesr enables to create test suites through natural language descriptions of screen content which it converts into structured test automation.

## The Prompt Behind This Test

> Analyze the 'Control Deck' UI currently visible on the screen. Based on your analysis, generate a test suite for all visible interactive elements. Please start with a brief summary of the main test categories and keep the descriptions for each test case concise and easy to understand. The suite should still cover positive, negative, and critical edge cases.

Watch how Caesr turns the prompt into test suite:

## From Prompt to Cases

Caesr used the UI to create a test suite that contained:

- **Authentication checks** - checking login and error functionalities
- **Form Validations** - The inputs' positive, negative and boundary
- **Navigation flows** - make it sure all buttons and links behave as expected
- **Edge cases** - empty fields, invalid formats, stalled actions

The result was not just the case lists. It was vey organized and compact and it can use for QA workflows immediately.

## Why This Changes QA

Writing and testing this would take hours. Caesr generates whole process in second, making easier for teams to:

- Caesr helps to speed up test planing
- It never skips edge cases
- Caesr shares cases that technical and non technical teams both can read easily.

## Where Caesr Can Take You

This demo shows Caesr creating a full test suite, but it doesn't stop there.

Try pointing Caesr at your own workflows ,you might be surprised at what a single prompt can unlock.
