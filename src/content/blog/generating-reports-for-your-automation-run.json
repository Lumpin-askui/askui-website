  "excerpt": "Caesr.ai eliminates Jest reporters. Switch from Legacy JS/TS to AI Agents for automated, visual test reports via Python.",
  "content": "<h2 id=\">IMPORTANT: Transition to AI Agent Reporting </h2><p id=\">The TypeScript/JavaScript SDK is no longer the primary method within AskUI. It is now the previous generation. This means manual integration of Jest reporters is an obsolete method. We strongly recommend switching automation logic to the Python SDK to leverage the automated reporting capabilities of the Caesr.ai AI Agent platform. Stop writing repetitive configuration files and manual image handling code.</p><h2 id=\">The Old Problem: Heavy Manual Configuration</h2><p id=\">To generate useful reports (XML, HTML) with the legacy system, developers had to:</p><ol start=\"1\" id=\"><li id=\">Install multiple separate <code id=\">npm</code> packages like <code id=\">jest-junit</code>, <code id=\">jest-html-reporters.</code></li><li id=\">Manually configure the <code id=\">jest.config.ts</code> file to include these reporters.</li><li id=\">Write complex TypeScript code to <strong id=\">manually process screenshots</strong> which converting base64 strings to buffers just to attach them to a report.This process required significant effort to maintain the reporting pipeline.</li></ol><h2 id=\">The New Solution: Automated Reporting with Caesr.ai</h2><p id=\"><strong id=\">Caesr.ai</strong> transforms reporting from a manual configuration burden into a <strong id=\">default, automated feature.</strong></p><h3 id=\">1. Instant, Rich Reporting</h3><p id=\">Every workflow executed by the <strong id=\">Caesr.ai AI Agent</strong> automatically generates a rich report. This report inherently includes:</p><ul id=\"><li id=\">Detailed steps of the AI Agent's execution.</li><li id=\"><strong id=\">Screenshots for every single action</strong> performed by the Agent.</li><li id=\">Assertions and final pass/fail status.</li></ul><p id=\">This eliminates the need for any Jest reporter packages, manual configuration files, or buffer processing code.</p><h3 id=\">2. Primary Language Focus</h3><p id=\">We strongly recommend utilizing the Python SDK which is AskUI's primary language. The system includes native support for Pytest and other common test runners which provides users with sophisticated reporting capabilities and CI/CD integration without requiring them to handle the complex TypeScript/Jest toolchain from previous versions.</p><h2 id=\">Reporting Becomes Automated, Not Configured</h2><p id=\">The time spent managing jest.config.ts files and manually converting images is over. The implementation of Caesr.ai enables reporting to transition from its current state as a delicate custom setup process into an automated standard function which enables your team to concentrate on automation development instead of reporter configuration.</p>",
