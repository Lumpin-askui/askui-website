Challenges in Automating Windows Applications

### Windows applications often feature dynamic interfaces that change based on user interactions, data updates, or system configurations. This variability makes it challenging for traditional automation tools, which rely on static element locators, to interact with user interface elements reliably.

### Diverse Applications

Windows applications are developed using a wide variety of technologies and frameworks, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to automation.

### Limited Accessibility

Traditional automation tools might struggle with applications that have limited programmatic accessibility, particularly legacy applications or those with custom-built components.
