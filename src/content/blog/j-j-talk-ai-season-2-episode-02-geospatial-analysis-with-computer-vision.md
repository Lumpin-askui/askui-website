JD (Johannes Dienst)**: In episode 2 we want to focus on geospatial analysis. What is that, Johannes?

JH (Johannes Haux)**: Well again, that's in terms of computer vision, something where we look at images, but in this case we're not looking at images of cats and dogs, but of images that potentially have been taken by satellites from the earth, from above basically.

JD**: But of cats and dogs. Either way, are you a cat or a dog?

JH**: I'm a cat person all the way. But I love dogs, so just that I wouldn't want to take too careful one at my home. Our cat probably wouldn't approve. Yeah, but of course, you know, you can use satellites to detect dogs or cats, so there might be applications there that I'm not aware of.

JD**: Okay, what can we do with satellite data, for example?

JH**: Well, you can do a lot.As we talked about last episode, computer vision applications are usually, like most applications, trying to make our lives easier to solve our tasks that involve looking at this data.There are a few prominent examples, I guess.For example, weather forecasts, right?That's where we work with geospatial data.I know where the clouds are.I know where there's high air pressure, low pressure fields, where's precipitation, where's the air moist.This kind of stuff. And I can use this data to build models.Usually you don't do this as a computer vision task, but I've seen approaches where you tryto take the two-dimensional projection of this data to make short-term forecasts.

JD**: Like a few hours for the rain that comes down.

JH**: Yeah, or let it be like 15 minutes. That can also be of importance, right?

JD**: These are actually pretty accurate. I always use this when I go for a walk.It just rains outside.

JH**: Oh, you do?

JD**: Yeah, it works.

**************************************Okay, this marks already the end of episode two.So I think we did not exhaust all the geospatial analysis applications, but I think the oneJohannes knows about.

JH**: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
