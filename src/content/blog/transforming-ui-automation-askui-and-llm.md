## The importance of rapidly prototyping and testing ideas cannot be overstated in today's fast-paced technology landscape. With the emergence of powerful tools like GPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs), businesses now have a remarkable resource to expedite these critical processes. In this article, we would like to share our vision for AskUI and its potential integration with LLMs, illustrating how it could redefine real-world applications.

## AskUI is a UI automation tool. While many might think of Selenium when they hear “user automation,” AskUI goes beyond it. Traditional tools like Selenium are dependent on the underlying website’s code. But what happens when the code changes? Or when you need to automate tasks on desktop applications? Enter AskUI, which leverages vision-based techniques, similar to human perception, to identify elements. So, it sees things like a human and you can ask it as if you ask your testing team to test specific actions like clicking a red button or signup button. Through object detection and other advanced methods, AskUI stands out as a robust automation tool that’s not just limited to web applications.

## One of the distinctive attributes of AskUI is its user-friendly Domain Specific Language (DSL). For instance, a command like 'aui.click().button().withText("Hello World").exec();' is designed to be self-explanatory. However, by aiming to cater to a broader audience, including financial analysts at esteemed institutions and everyday individuals, we've recognized the potential for a more intuitive interaction. Our goal is to seamlessly convert natural language instructions into AskUI DSL commands.
