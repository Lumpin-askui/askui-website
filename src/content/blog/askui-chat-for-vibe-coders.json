You install and launch it with:</p><pre id=\"></pre><p id=\">This runs a local server that waits for your natural language instructions and performs the matching UI actions.</p><p id=\">his starts a local server that waits for your natural language instructions and carries out tasks by literally “looking at” your screen and performing the necessary actions.</p><p id=\"><strong id=\">Note:</strong> This feature is currently in <strong id=\">public beta</strong>.
