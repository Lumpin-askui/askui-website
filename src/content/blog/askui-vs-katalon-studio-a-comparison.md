## FAQs

### What's the difference between visual automation and selector-based automation?

**Visual automation** (like AskUI) interacts with elements based on what's displayed on screen—just like a human would.

**Selector-based automation** (like Katalon) depends on HTML or object selectors, which can break if the UI changes.

### Can I use AskUI for testing non-browser apps?

Yes. AskUI can automate **desktop applications, Android apps**, and even **canvas-based UIs**.

### Which tool is better for non-developers?

AskUI, thanks to its **Prompt-to-Action** feature, allows anyone to write automation instructions in **plain English**.
