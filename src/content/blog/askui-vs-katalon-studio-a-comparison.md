## FAQ

### Question Title
What types of applications are best suited for AskUI?

AskUI excels in automating applications with visual UIs, canvas-based elements, or custom desktop interfaces. Its vision-based approach eliminates the need for traditional selectors, making it ideal for applications where the UI is constantly changing or difficult to access programmatically.

### Question Title
Can Katalon Studio be used by non-technical users?

Katalon Studio offers both no-code and low-code options, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. While some features require scripting knowledge, the platform provides a user-friendly interface and pre-built keywords that enable non-technical users to create and execute basic tests.

### Question Title
How does AskUI handle dynamic UI elements?

AskUI's vision-based AI can visually recognize and interact with dynamic UI elements, even if their position or attributes change. This makes it more resilient to UI updates compared to traditional selector-based automation tools. Custom AI Models can be trained to enhance accuracy and adaptability.

### Question Title
What level of CI/CD integration does Katalon Studio offer?

Katalon Studio integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tools. This allows for automated testing as part of the software development lifecycle, enabling continuous testing and faster release cycles. The platform also supports integration with popular CI/CD platforms.

### Question Title
What are the key differences between vision-based and selector-based UI automation?

Vision-based UI automation, like AskUI, uses AI to visually identify and interact with UI elements, mimicking human interaction and eliminating reliance on code-based selectors. Selector-based automation, often relying on DOM or XPath, uses element attributes to identify UI objects. Vision-based automation is more resilient to UI changes but can be slower, while selector-based automation is faster but more susceptible to breakage when UI attributes change.
