The process of verifying that a live website matches its design mockup proves to be a difficult and time-consuming task. You examine all areas of the page while documenting all discrepancies between text elements and spacing and color usage before submitting each finding individually. The process requires endless repetition while being prone to mistakes and extending into an excessively long duration.

But what if you could run that check with just one prompt.

## Caesr

Caesr is an automation chat built for real work, not just small tasks. Instead of spending hours pixel-pushing to check if a website matches its design in reviewing process., you give Caesr a single instruction. It analyzes both sides design and implementation and flags the differences instantly.

## The Prompt in Action

> Compare the Figma design on the left screen with the CodePen website on the right screen, and list all the visual and content differences.

## Watch the Demo

### From Prompt to Design QA

Caesr read the instruction before examining both sides to create an organized list of all detected mismatches which included typography problems, spacing errors, color inconsistencies, and absent text elements.The tool did not function as a screenshot comparison tool. Caesr understood the task requirements so it analyzed the content before delivering a detailed description of all observed differences.

### Why It Matters

Design reviews are often a bottleneck. Developers and designers spend hours chasing details that slip through.

With Caesr, you get:

- **Accuracy** — consistent checks across every page
- **Speed** — instant results without manual side-by-side scanning
- **Clarity** — clear descriptions that teams can act on immediately

## More Than Pixel Matching

This example shows Caesr catching design and build issues, but the same approach extends to document comparisons, content audits, or UI regressions.
