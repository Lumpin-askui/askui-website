## What's the main difference?

Claude Computer Use and OpenAI Operator are primarily built for automating web-based workflows through virtual machines. AskUI takes a different approach—designed to handle direct automation across web, desktop, and native mobile applications, without relying on VMs. This often makes it a stronger fit for quality assurance and enterprise environments that require stable, maintainable automation.

## What are Claude Computer Use and OpenAI Operator designed for?

Both tools focus on general web automation tasks.

- **Claude Computer Use** is suited for web research and synthesizing information across multiple sites.
- **OpenAI Operator** automates repetitive document handling, web form filling, and file processing.

### Common scenarios

- Aggregating competitor data from various websites and summarizing results.
- Downloading and merging PDFs from different sources.

## What makes AskUI different?

AskUI is purpose-built for cross-platform automation, covering web, desktop, and native mobile apps. It's designed to support QA teams and enterprise process owners who need consistent test execution or workflow automation that goes beyond the browser.

### Typical applications

- Testing workflows that span a web dashboard, a desktop ERP, and a mobile approval app.
- Extracting invoice data from email PDFs into SAP, including attachment handling and record updates.
- Migrating structured customer data from legacy systems to modern platforms like Microsoft Dynamics.

## How do they compare in platform coverage?

| Tool | Web | Desktop Apps | Mobile Apps | Requires VM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude / Operator | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| AskUI | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

AskUI's approach, which avoids virtual machines entirely, often translates into faster execution and simpler maintenance—benefits that become critical at scale.

## Why do teams often lean toward AskUI for QA and automation?

- No virtual machines or complex environments to manage.
- Supports true cross-platform testing—web, desktop, and native mobile.
- Self-healing automation that adapts when UI layouts change.
- Open source core, allowing transparency and deeper customization.
- Enterprise features like audit trails, access controls, and secure deployments.
- Natural language interface, making it easier for non-engineers to contribute to automation scenarios.

### When should each tool be used?

| Scenario | Recommended Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-website research and data aggregation | Claude Computer Use |
| Downloading PDFs, filling online forms | OpenAI Operator |
| QA testing across platforms, ERP or CI/CD integration, data migration | AskUI |

## What about limitations?

AskUI is best applied to structured automation and continuous testing scenarios. For general-purpose personal computer tasks or ad-hoc research, Claude and Operator might be simpler. Also, teams should plan for some initial technical setup to tailor AskUI to their specific environments.

## FAQ

**Is AskUI free to try?**  
Yes. It includes a free trial with 500 Asks, giving teams enough volume to build and validate meaningful automation cases.

**Can AskUI automate real native mobile apps?**  
It can. Unlike many browser-focused tools, AskUI directly handles native iOS and Android interfaces.

**Does AskUI rely on virtual machines?**  
No. It automates existing applications directly, which often means lower infrastructure overhead.
