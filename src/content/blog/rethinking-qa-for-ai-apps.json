Every validation is logged with screenshots and metadata &nbsp;perfect evidence for security, privacy, and accessibility audits.</p><p id=\"><strong id=\">How does this affect engineering velocity?</strong><br>It replaces what used to take manual testers days, letting teams validate builds in hours.<br>You keep moving fast without sacrificing trust.</p><p id=\"><strong id=\">Can it really control interfaces without coding or selectors?</strong><br>Yes. In our beta demo, the agent changed a setting in an Android app using only a natural language instruction. It visually located the control, interacted with it, and confirmed the result — no backend access required.</p><h2 id=\">🚀 Try the Beta Now</h2><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><div style=\"margin-top: 2.5rem; padding: 1.2rem; background: #f9fafb; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; border-radius: 6px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> 🚀 Want to see how it works in practice? <a href=\"https://hub.askui.com/workspaces/f2f0272d-06ba-4de9-9edd-fe4030f07d07/chat\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;\"> Try our beta version here. </a> </div></div>",
