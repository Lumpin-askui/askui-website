### QA Without the Manual Grind **

Caesr successfully integrates all the information into one single prompt.

What is Caesr?

The tool accepts instructions written in everyday  language which it converts into sequential steps before executing them through the user interface.

For developers building fast-moving apps and QA engineers under pressure to keep up with rapid release cycles, Caesr delivers the speed of AI with the depth of human-like testing.

## Perform an in-depth, human-like quality assurance analysis on the “ArtisanAura” web application. Simulate a real user journey and cover the following scenarios in order:

1) **User Onboarding & Authentication**— On the homepage, scroll to the bottom to confirm all sections render; scroll back to the top; locate “Sign in with Google”; attempt to sign in; report whether auth completes, fails, or stalls.
2)**Mobile Shopping & Responsive Design**— Navigate to**All Products**; set viewport to**400px**width; slowly scroll the entire product list like a shopper; note any overlaps, broken layouts, or text overflow.
3)**Content Discovery & Performance**— In desktop view on**All Products**, scroll to the very bottom; click**Load More**; measure and report the time (seconds) until new products fully render.
4)**End-to-End Search & Filter**— From the homepage, go to**All Products**; scroll at least two rows; open a specific product (e.g., “Handmade Ceramic Mug”); on the detail page verify title, image, price are visible; go back; search for**“ceramic”**; apply the**$51–$100**price filter; verify only items in that range appear.
5)**Information Architecture & Footer Navigation**— Return to the homepage; scroll to the absolute bottom; in the footer, find**Shipping & Returns**(may be small text); open it and confirm it navigates to the shipping policy page.

For each issue, categorize severity (**Critical / Major / Minor**), add a suspected root cause, a proposed fix, and attach a screenshot with clear annotations.

### How Caesr Ran the Test **

full QA flow**:
************
- Realistic coverage**— duplicate the way users would naturally interact with the site.

- Structured reporting**— provides structured reporting which includes severity ratings and both cause identification and solution recommendations for each issue.

- Faster iteration**— becomes faster because developers eliminate the need to recreate their scripts for each regression cycle.

**Website QA is just one application. The same natural language approach can be applied to:
********… and much more. The beginning of this is only the start because you can try your own prompts to see what Caesr can automate for you.

✨ Caesr officially launches on September 30.
QA is only one example, see how far a single prompt with Caesr can go.
