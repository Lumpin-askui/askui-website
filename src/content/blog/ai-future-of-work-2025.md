## How Will AI Change Our Jobs, Education, and Society?

AI is no longer a future technology—it's actively transforming industries, reshaping how we work, learn, and define purpose. In the coming years, AI will:

- Replace many routine and manual jobs across industries
- Shift education toward creativity, problem-solving, and AI collaboration
- Spark debates on universal basic income (UBI) and redefine the role of work in society
- Accelerate research into more advanced AI stages: Theory of Mind AI and Self-Aware AI

Who should read this: QA Managers, Test Automation Leaders, CTOs, L&D professionals, and anyone preparing their organization for an AI-powered workplace.

## The 4 Stages of AI Development

Understanding where AI stands today helps predict what's next. AI development typically progresses through these stages:

### 1. Reactive Machine AI (The First Generation)

- **Description:** No memory or learning; reacts only to current input
- **Examples:** Early chess bots, basic recommendation systems
- **Relevance:** Foundation for modern algorithms but limited adaptability

### 2. Limited Memory AI (Current Mainstream)

- **Description:** Can store and reference limited past data
- **Examples:** Tesla's self-driving software, ChatGPT, virtual assistants
- **Relevance to Work:** Drives today's AI-powered automation in customer service, QA automation, predictive analytics, and decision support

### 3. Theory of Mind AI (Emerging Research Stage)

- **Description:** AI that understands human emotions, intentions, and social contexts
- **Potential Use Cases:**
  - Adaptive customer support agents
  - Emotionally intelligent QA bots
  - Human-centered automation design

### 4. Self-Aware AI (Speculative / AGI)

- **Description:** Fully conscious AI that understands its existence
- **Current Status:** Theoretical; no verified examples exist
- **Relevance:** Philosophical and ethical implications for the future of labor, law, and society

## Can AI Understand Emotions Today?

- **Short Answer:** Not fully
- AI can simulate emotional understanding using sentiment analysis, facial recognition, and natural language processing
- However, true comprehension of human emotions remains a theoretical goal tied to Theory of Mind AI
- The Turing Test still serves as a benchmark: if humans cannot distinguish AI from a person, is that enough?

## The Future of Work: Will AI Replace Our Jobs?

### Automation Is Already Reshaping Industries

| Industry | Current AI Impact | Future AI Potential |
|---|---|---|
| **Manufacturing** | Robotics, predictive maintenance | Fully automated smart factories |
| **QA & Software Testing** | Test automation tools (e.g. AskUI, ChatGPT-powered QA) | Agentic AI autonomously building & fixing tests |
| **Design & Art** | Generative AI (DALL·E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly) | Real-time AI-driven design collaboration |
| **Music & Media** | AI composers (AIVA, Soundful) | Personalized content creation at scale |
| **Healthcare** | Diagnostics & scheduling AI | AI-driven treatment planning & real-time monitoring |

### Key Takeaways for QA Managers & Automation Leaders:

- **Test Automation Will Shift:** From script-based frameworks to context-aware agentic AI
- **Human Oversight Still Critical:** AI lacks full adaptability in complex edge cases
- **New Roles Will Emerge:** AI trainers, ethical auditors, and AI collaboration designers

## Education in the AI Era: What Should We Teach?

### Traditional Skills Becoming Automated

- Coding, graphic design, and even writing can be automated to some extent
- Learning platforms like GitHub Copilot, Grammarly, or Figma AI assist or replace certain manual skills

### Future-Proof Skills for the Workforce

- **Human Creativity:** Complex problem-solving, innovation
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Leadership, communication, empathy
- **AI Collaboration:** Knowing how to work alongside AI tools effectively
- **Critical Thinking:** Ethical reasoning, bias identification, decision validation

Tip for L&D Leaders: Future training programs should blend technical literacy with soft skill mastery.

## Redefining "Work" in an AI World

Work may no longer mean routine labor but will involve:

- Supervision of AI-driven processes
- Decision-making and creative strategy
- Ethical governance of AI systems
- Personal fulfillment outside of employment (UBI discussions gaining traction)

This shift will impact:

- Corporate structures
- Job market expectations
- Personal identity tied to work

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will AI take all jobs?

- **No.** AI will automate many tasks but will also create new roles that focus on supervision, design, and ethical governance

### Should we still learn coding?

- **Yes, but differently.** Understanding AI-assisted coding will be more valuable than memorizing syntax

### How should QA teams prepare for AI?

- Invest in next-generation agentic AI tools—such as visual automation platforms that combine context awareness, dynamic workflow adaptation, and robust UI interaction. Solutions like AskUI represent early examples of this transition
- Upskill teams on AI oversight and ethical considerations

## What This Means for QA, Automation, and the Future of Work

AI isn't coming—it's already rewriting how businesses operate. The leaders who act now will shape the standards for the next decade.

**For QA Leaders:**

- Start experimenting with agentic AI for UI and regression testing
- Build hybrid test teams where AI assists but humans validate edge cases
- Invest in continuous AI upskilling for QA staff

**For Test Automation Teams:**

- Prioritize automation that adapts to dynamic UIs instead of brittle scripted tests
- Evaluate visual, agentic, and natural language-powered test automation platforms, many of which are emerging as practical alternatives to traditional script-based approaches

**For L&D and Workforce Development:**

- Shift curriculums toward AI literacy, ethical reasoning, and AI collaboration skills
- Prepare teams for ongoing reskilling cycles as AI capabilities evolve

The organizations that combine human expertise with adaptive AI will outperform those who wait.

This isn't about replacing people—it's about empowering them for a fundamentally different kind of work.

If you're exploring how to bring adaptive, agentic AI into your QA or automation processes, platforms like AskUI are already helping teams take that first step.
