  "excerpt": "Learn how QA teams can move from manual to automated testing with a clear roadmap—featuring real-world success from Zucchetti.",
  "content": "<p id=\">Manual testing has long been the foundation of QA. It’s hands-on, flexible, and ideal for early-stage development. But as products grow more complex and release cycles accelerate, manual testing alone can’t keep up.</p><p id=\">To deliver consistent quality at speed, teams need to evolve and test automation is the way forward.</p><p id=\">👉 Curious how a real QA team made this shift?<br><a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.askui.com/customers/from-manual-testing-to-automated-excellence-zucchettis-success-with-askui\" id=\"><strong id=\">See how Zucchetti transformed their testing with AskUI</strong></a></p><h2 id=\">The Limits of Manual Testing</h2><p id=\">Manual testing offers adaptability, but it doesn’t scale:</p><ul id=\"><li id=\">It’s slow when test coverage grows</li><li id=\">Results vary depending on who runs the test</li><li id=\">Regression testing becomes a bottleneck before every release</li></ul><p id=\">QA teams are expected to move faster without sacrificing quality. Automation helps bridge that gap &nbsp;enabling the shift from <strong id=\">manual to automated testing</strong> across the entire pipeline.</p><h2 id=\">Automation: Beyond Speed</h2><p id=\">Test automation isn’t just about running tests faster. It brings:</p><ul id=\"><li id=\">Consistency across test runs</li><li id=\">Earlier bug detection</li><li id=\">Freed-up time for strategic, exploratory testing</li></ul><p id=\">And with tools like <strong id=\">AskUI</strong>, even highly dynamic UIs or apps without stable selectors can be tested &nbsp;using a visual approach that mimics how humans interact with the UI.</p><h2 id=\">A Practical Roadmap for QA Automation</h2><h3 id=\">1. <strong id=\">Start with the Right Test Cases</strong></h3><p id=\">Focus on repetitive, stable, and business-critical flows: login, checkout, form submission, etc.</p><h3 id=\">2. <strong id=\">Pick Tools That Fit Your App</strong></h3><p id=\">Traditional tools may struggle with modern UIs. Visual automation platforms like AskUI interact directly with rendered elements &nbsp;perfect for canvas-based or visually complex apps.</p><h3 id=\">3. <strong id=\">Begin Small, Build Modular</strong></h3><p id=\">Start with one test, break it into reusable blocks (e.g., “login,” “navigate,” “assert result”). This makes scaling easier later.</p><h3 id=\">4. <strong id=\">Involve the Team</strong></h3><p id=\">Use tools that allow non-developers to understand and contribute to test automation. Collaboration improves both coverage and test design.</p><h3 id=\">5. <strong id=\">Track Progress</strong></h3><p id=\">Measure:</p><ul id=\"><li id=\">Time saved</li><li id=\">Bugs caught pre-release</li><li id=\">Test stability across updates</li></ul><p id=\">Use this to iterate and expand automation over time.</p><h2 id=\">Case in Point: Zucchetti's QA Transformation</h2><p id=\">Zucchetti, a major European software company, faced the usual manual testing challenges: time-consuming workflows, regressions slipping through, and difficulty scaling tests for a complex UI.</p><p id=\">By adopting AskUI, they reduced test time, improved accuracy, and gave their QA team the freedom to focus on higher-value work.</p><p id=\">Zucchetti’s story is a clear example of <strong id=\">test automation success</strong> &nbsp;showing what’s possible when QA teams commit to meaningful transformation.</p><h2 id=\">What’s Next for QA Teams?</h2><p id=\">As software continues to evolve rapidly, QA teams are expected to do more &nbsp;without slowing down delivery. While manual testing still plays a key role, it can no longer scale alone.</p><p id=\">By combining automation with human expertise, teams can ensure both speed and quality. And with tools like AskUI, even testing visually complex or dynamic UIs becomes simpler than ever.</p><p id=\">Whether you're just starting or scaling your automation strategy, a clear roadmap and the right technology make all the difference.</p><p id=\">👉 <strong id=\">See how Zucchetti successfully made this shift — and how your team can too:</strong><br><a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.askui.com/customers/from-manual-testing-to-automated-excellence-zucchettis-success-with-askui\" id=\"><strong id=\">From Manual Testing to Automated Excellence with AskUI</strong></a></p><p id=\">‍</p><p id=\">‍</p>",
