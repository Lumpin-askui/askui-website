## What Is the Difference Between AskUI and Airtest?

**AskUI** focuses on AI-driven, visual UI automation powered by natural language input.

**Airtest** targets game testing with image recognition and Python-based scripting.

## What Is AskUI?

AskUI is an AI-powered automation tool designed to interact with user interfaces visually, like a human. It supports automation across desktop, web, and even canvas-based applications. The platform does not rely on fragile DOM selectors or element hierarchies—instead, it uses advanced visual recognition to identify elements on-screen.

### Key Features of AskUI

- **Prompt-to-Action (PTA):** Automate using natural language. No coding required.
- **Cross-platform support:** MacOS, Windows, Linux.
- **Deployment options:** Local, cloud, or hybrid environments.
- **Third-party integrations:** Supports Zapier, n8n, Docker, Jenkins.
- **AI fine-tuning:** Customize pre-trained models (e.g., UIDT) with your own data.

AskUI is ideal for teams seeking resilient, low-maintenance automation with minimal scripting.

## What Is Airtest?

Airtest is a script-based UI test automation tool focused primarily on game testing. Developed by NetEase, it uses image recognition and UI hierarchy analysis to automate app interactions across Android, Windows, and web platforms.

### Key Features of Airtest

- **Game engine support:** Especially strong for Unity-based games.
- **Multi-platform testing:** Android, Windows, iOS (with Poco), and web (with Selenium plugin).
- **Airtest IDE:** Cross-platform scripting environment (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu).
- **Script recording:** One-click script recording and playback for quick test creation.
- **Python-based scripting:** Full flexibility for developers.

Airtest is best suited for QA teams working on mobile games, apps, or cross-device experiences where scripting is preferred.

## AskUI vs Airtest: Real-World Use Case Comparison

| Use Case Scenario | AskUI | Airtest |
|---|---|---|
| Automating legacy desktop apps | Works across canvas and desktop UIs visually | Limited unless UI elements are easily recognized |
| Testing Unity-based mobile games | Not designed for game engines | One-click recording & Unity-specific features |
| Cross-platform UI automation (macOS/Win/Linux) | Full support for all major OSs | Available via Airtest IDE with scripting |
| Natural language-based UI testing | Prompt-to-Action, no code needed | Requires Python scripting |
| Non-technical stakeholder collaboration | Easily share prompt-based flows | Requires technical understanding |

## Which Tool Should You Choose?

**Choose AskUI if:**

- Your team lacks coding expertise.
- You need automation across varied app types (web, desktop, canvas).
- UI changes frequently and break element-based scripts.
- You're focused on fast test creation via natural language.

**Choose Airtest if:**

- You're automating mobile or game apps (e.g., Unity).
- Your team prefers Python scripting.
- You need native element access on Android/iOS.
- You value record-and-playback for testing.

## What Makes AskUI Unique?

AskUI's two standout advantages are:

1. **Visual UI Recognition:** It sees and understands the UI like a human, enabling it to automate dynamic interfaces that break traditional tools.
2. **Natural Language Interface:** Its Prompt-to-Action (PTA) lets non-developers build automation just by describing what needs to be done.

This combination makes AskUI more inclusive and future-proof as automation becomes more accessible.

## FAQ: Choosing Between AskUI and Airtest

### Which platform is better for non-technical QA teams?

AskUI is more accessible for non-developers thanks to its natural language automation. Airtest, on the other hand, requires scripting skills.

### Can Airtest fully automate iOS apps?

Airtest can interact with native iOS elements using Poco, but configuration is more complex and less stable than Android automation.

### Does AskUI support advanced automation workflows?

Yes. While AskUI is no-code by default, it can be extended with CI/CD tools, APIs, and integrations like Docker and Jenkins.

### Is Airtest suitable for dynamic, frequently changing UIs?

Not ideally. Since Airtest depends on static image recognition, it's less effective when UI layouts frequently change.

## Final Thoughts

If you're looking for code-free, visually-driven automation across platforms, **AskUI** is a future-ready choice.

For developers testing mobile games or apps in Unity or Android, **Airtest** remains a flexible, script-friendly option.

Evaluate based on your team's technical comfort, platform focus, and UI complexity.
