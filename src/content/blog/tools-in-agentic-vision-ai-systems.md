Leveraging Pre-Trained Models

-**Object Detection**: Identifying players and equipment.

-**Pose Estimation**: Analyzing body positions.

Rather than building these functionalities from scratch, developers can take advantage of pre-trained models and open-source tools from platforms like Hugging Face. This approach streamlines development and takes advantage of cutting-edge advancements in AI.

## Vision AI agents act as conductors, orchestrating a variety of tools to perform complex visual tasks. The dynamic nature of computer vision means new models and tools frequently emerge, offering enhanced capabilities. Integrating these into applications can be daunting, but vision AI agents simplify this process, ensuring the system remains current and effective.
