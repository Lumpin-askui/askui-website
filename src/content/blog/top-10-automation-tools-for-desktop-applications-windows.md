Desktop applications need installation and configuration, followed by execution on a desktop OS, which could be macOS, Linux, or Windows. Hence, for desktop applications to be operational, end-users need to use a PC or a laptop that features sufficient hardware resources.

In this article, we will go through a list of the finest Automation tools that automate the desktop app’s functional testing.

## 1. WinAppDriver **

**For WPF and WinForms app testing, Winium is an open-source Test Automation framework. Just as in the case of WinAppDriver, Winium is also based on the WebDriver protocol. But upon comparison, Winium may not be able to match up with WinAppDriver in several areas. Since 2016, Winium has not been maintained actively, so a tester has to add improvements or fix bugs by themself.

## 3. TestArchitect **

**As a test automation tool, Ranorex has been in the market for a long time. Anorex offers proprietary Automation technologies that aid with the automation of mobile apps, web apps, and desktop apps. In particular, in the Japanese markets, Ranorex enjoys a strong presence, because of their reliable record & playback, and Japanese localization.

## 5. Tricentis Tosca **

**SmartBear TestComplete has been in the automation market since 1999. This makes SmartBear one of the veterans. In the case of TestComplete (TC), one accesses a comprehensive solution covering mobile, web, and desktop. TC has also recently added a hybrid UI matching method that combines object recognition and visual recognition. The testing method of TC is keyword-driven, and even the non-technical testers can use it.

## 7. Micro Focus UFT (formerly HP QTP) **

**As an open-source tool, SkiuliX uses OCR and image recognition to automate all things visible on the screen. Nevertheless, the default use case of SikuliX is small projects since it has been designed for automating mundane tasks on Windows. Still, upon scaling up, you’d come across unsolvable problems. These problems occur because of the nature of image recognition techniques. In essence, image recognition is slower than object recognition.

## 9. AskUI **

If you are unsure where to start, you can[**Another one of the open-source tools driven by keywords is the Robot Framework. Robot’s flexibility is highlighted by the fact that it can be used with numerous desktop Automation libraries, including SwingLibrary (Java Swing GUI), SapGuiLibrary, SikuliLibrary (SikuliX), AutoItLibrary (AutoIt), and EclipseLibrary (Eclipse RCP/SWT).
